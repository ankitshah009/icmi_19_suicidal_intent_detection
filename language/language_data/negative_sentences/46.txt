the story is kind of sad because the boy that it was he actually passed away like we really done another breakdown, even though i'm kind of hated right now i don't like it when you're not around, so i think we need to figure this right
it's so sad um, i'm not saying any names
i got so mad like i'm, trying to push him in the water, but it's just saying work so now i'm feeling barest and i feel stupid and i'm just mad because i'm like i just told you not to push him in the water
so i storm out of the little pool area and i go directly back into my father's house - climb over the little banner still biting me not going there, i'm in the bathroom dry myself off or whatever all this net, and then i go in the kitchen
he said, i'm sorry, i didn't know that you were going to get mad
am i to understand i'm like way back so where we are now he's like you know, i'm sorry, i didn't notice you're gon na get mad
i don't know i wasn't like 14, so ashley's getting closer to me
he just kissed me and i'm just like my mouth is just like open, i'm just like it's like i don't know it seemed like the moment was happening so long fast-forward
i got this bad habit where i flirt with people, and i don't mean to you know what i'm saying like i flirt with
you know but like my feet are like down or like so like, like just send down, and he comes like this and he goes straight like this and just like pushes me back and just go like this and so start kissing collected i'm just i'm sitting there
no socks, not the only insurance as we were kissing he like started pulling down my trunks
he um he poured down his swim trunks and, like you, can tell like the the male was getting like horny and he's like kissing me and i and in my head, it's like i'm kissing little bet, but i'm thinking like this can't happen
so, in the midst of all this he's like kissing on my neck, trying to push them off, trying to push them off me and everything and um it was like it was just so much going on
if i reached 135 clearly taller than me bigger than me he's not he wasn't big, but he was like bigger than me
you know what i mean like he's like, i don't know, so i'm like trying to push them off me and i'm just like
i remember pause them for that 15 seconds and then, as he keeps going, it was just i was so shocked
i was like, and then i had green because it hurt after like i was like, and i just yelled and he covered my mouth and was like what the are you doing and i'm like stop i'm like stop
i was, i don't know, i don't know how i felt it was just like a bad feeling
