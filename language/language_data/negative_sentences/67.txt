so it's kind of unfair to me that i'm just here he is there, i mean we were really close and it's not fair and i don't know - maybe it's not fair that i'm going to do this and everyone's just going to be stuck here
i guess i just do it in a bad way
i didn't know how, to date, like i honestly didn't know how i'm surprised, honestly, that i losted that long, because you took my shit, you dealt with my shit, you fucking handled it for me, like i, don't know how you did that, like you were so into my problems that i feel felt like i didn't even have any at the time, and maybe that's what i missed
maybe i missed having those problems, because i just hate putting that burden on people and i'm really sorry alex
this is the one thing that i hate that i am so confused
you know - maybe i am straight or lesbian, i don't know my mom says: there's really no such thing as sexual, but i guess she just says that because she's straight and she doesn't know really, it is so uncomfortable and i'm sorry i don't mean to hurt any of you by doing this, i really don't i'm just so sad, so i guess this is goodbye seriously
