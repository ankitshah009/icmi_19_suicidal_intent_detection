since i was about 9, i can't really remember what year this happened for some reason and i don't really feel like looking it up
it's not that bad and then it randomly just went to stage 4 and then he randomly um just passed away
i don't i think three years and i would have to go pretty much once every three days or something like that and it was pretty miserable because they would always have to like check my weight and stuff because they thought i was too skinny and then i'd feel bad about myself and i feel like i'm, not gaining weight, i'm not eating healthy enough, i'm too skinny and there was just a lot of bad things happening that year, those years it was like about four years that was really depressed
i went to, i think three institutions for like a week each and one was really scary one
i had a stay there and it was like actually crazy people and they're like no offense to crazy people, but they're people that, were you, know, little loony and i actually got thrown in there
i was gon na get killed by a guy for no fucking reason, which was really scary, and i think that guy was my roommate
if i can remember, it was really fucking scary - and i remember talk to my mom and being like - i need to get the fuck out of here because they're some guy that wants to kick my ass and then next thing
i would just i just remember, i'm sitting on my house like the roof of it and just thinking and just wanting to jump off like and just fucking end it, but for some reason i did it because i felt there was a little light at the end of this road like there was just a reason for me to keep on pushing, even though my life was feeling like complete and utter crap, and i didn't think i didn't think anything would get better
i just i was just i was really mean
i was just a bad kid back, then i was really misunderstood and i treated my family like crap and i treated a lot of things like crap and i just had a lot of bad things happen and i don't really feel like getting into those right now
yeah, so suicide and all that and cutting it fucking sucks guys it's it's the worst pain
it feels like there's, no there's no getting better and that's the worst is that you feel like stuck
i thought there's no turning back, there's no better days every day was hell and i just wanted to end it and god i can't fucking think
i have actually really bad skin
