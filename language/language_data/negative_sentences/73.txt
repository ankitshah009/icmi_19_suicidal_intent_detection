it happens all the time with everyone and i'm tired of being played with and i'm tired of feeling like shit like i'm nobody important like like honestly, i can die right now and the only people that actually care would get over it like it tears all over
i mean, i guess i should try to get some sleep clear my mind, but when i sleep i just don't ever want to wake up
if i said that, since i mean i've tried, i'm thinking about it now, i just i don't know what to do in life anymore
