i was with deacon in the bathtub and i was just hysterically crying because he had just completely flipped out on us about nothing
so i have a horrible memory, horrible memory, but i do remember a few things and that was that was one of them
so the the the verbal abuse of it it started getting really ugly and it wasn't something that you know i was necessarily comfortable with, but i blamed things like stress
in hindsight, you can see that he he was not there and that's when things i mean really that's when things started to get bad, we moved to be closer to his work and to save some money, because at that time i had i put my job to become a stay-at-home mom because financially it just kind of it, it almost made more sense
oh ah, so this is when i said not long ago, if i have any regrets i'd be, i would i wouldn't just make up excuses for things
at one point i remember he got mad at deacon, he was in the bath, he wasn't, he was giving deacon a bath and he got mad at deacon and i was doing the dishes or something - and i looked down the hallway and deacon sitting in the hallway sob soaking wet naked just screaming, and i'm like what is going on he's like he splashed like
so i've heard quite some time it was really i mean it was really bad and he blamed lending people
so all this money was missing yeah and i had some speculations like i thought
i don't remember exactly what happened, but as wallet was open and i saw a registration in it michael, why is our registration in there and they took it out and opened it up, and there was some course dolly things in the bottom of it
but i found this substance in his wallet and at this point i mean things have gotten so ugly, so ugly, and at this point i had i had text his dad and i said i need to talk to you
i didn't know what it was later: i'd found out that it was math and it it was ugly and again i had to bail him out of all of it and i did and i stood by his side and my dad had my dad hadn't
i don't know if i ever mentioned this in my videos or now, but with remote-control helicopters, where every single night he would get home and he would diligently work on these things and everybody else just got snapped it
the reason my table so destroyed outside the fact that i've kind of just totally let it go, especially with all these kids, but he had glue on the table and paint on the table, and he had all this, like horrible horrible smelling glue that he was using
i didn't know that this was a sign of anything because he had told me that he had stopped and that he was only using it in his coffee in the morning or his protein shakes in the morning when we were doing p90x
all the time with her um but instantly and that's when i went and i stayed at my parents house and that's when you guys started noticing like i wasn't wearing my ring, i tried for so long to try to my dad offered what is it? oh rehab, my dad offered care of it for him
it sucks so bad to know
so this is why, when he sees the kids at supervise, he doesn't have custody over them, probably why he doesn't have a job and the worst part about it is
um, it's a shame, and now i mean i can talk for another 10 hours about this topic, but i just i guess, i'll open it up to questions now
it's been bad and it's only affecting me harder and harder and worse and worse and everything else every day
