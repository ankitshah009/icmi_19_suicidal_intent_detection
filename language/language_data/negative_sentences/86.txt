it's quite broken, and i'm i've been drinking a lot of this right now, so i'm sort of drunk and i'm feeling really down like extremely down, and i will tell you why it's cuz, my entire life, have been treated quite bad
i may look quite bad, but there are people that have it hundreds times worse, so i'm not comparing myself to the worst of the worst
my mom gave them cigarettes and stuff, so they were like my guardian sorta and they were the first people to call me ugly and things went on and i ended up in school
i guess there was something wrong with me
it is so difficult making because i'm also drunk - and i don't really know if i want to make this - i'm trying to do this anyway, so i was okay, wait
so that's something i heard a lot and after two years i gave up, i gave up totally and when i gave up, i started to care more about writing with people who had it difficult or sad and like i didn't, have it easy and that's when i first met the first girl in my life that wanted to be with me, and i spent seven years with that girl, and i regret it very much because that was a girl that treated me so badly and was just using me
that's the worst thing i ever felt and i was like screw this nope and i was alone in a cabin in in the middle of nowhere in the woods it's a movie, i know, but i was literally living in a cabin
i mean you can say alcohol, because it's not that bad but like i was drinking a lot anyway
so we didn't really stay friends anyway, after after that time i sort of got really annoyed of being alone and my ex wanted to come come and visit me
i was with for all those years that treated me so bad and i was so weak
so it wasn't that bad, but it didn't work out because i was so unhappy
we were just tearing each other down and i couldn't forget all all the things in the past and like we had nothing in common except just being angry on each other, so we broke up and with that was about five months ago now and i move past everything quite easily so, one month ago, after we broke up, i started to try and date again and the bombardments of you are ugly or not
if you can, i'm repeating myself because i'm running out of things to say - and this is probably the only video i can ever do right now - if by any chance, you guys will like this - whoever watches it, if even anyone watches it - i don't know - i don't know hope it goes better for you
