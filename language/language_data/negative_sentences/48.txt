this is probably the ugliest you're ever going to see me like, because i haven't looked this bad a long time and the reason why looks like bad is because i probably been crying non-stop for the past three days
this is the worst time of my entire life
there's no feeling worse than what i'm feeling and i don't know what's gon na happen, because, as i'm recording this, i don't know what's going on in my relationship, we're supposed to have broken up, but no i i'm not
i can't solve egde this and i'm trying so hard because it's my entire life - and i hate everything except this
so that's why i'm talking to this camera because it can't talk back, because i don't want people to talk back to me because i hate people giving me advice, because it makes me feel worse when people say shit to be like
i know that's horrible, but if you knew how i felt right now, when you're alone and you're crying and there's no one here to comfort you, we could see just laughs
but i just i just can't i just couldn't do it because life is this bad now i can't stop thinking about everything this
no, i i'm sorry
well, it already have a digestive problem and anxiety makes it like really worse it, because the stress on your in like and gastrointestinal tract or whatever it is like it just just fucks it up had always seemed stress and anxiety whatever like it's all that, and i'm surprised i haven't had a panic attack
i'm sorry, it doesn't make me feel worse
you don't feel sorry for me because this nothing, you guys could do to save me
but the thing is, i don't want to die as i do want to experience the rest of my life, but if i have to feel like this, that's the only way out there is nothing else
there's nothing don't come at me with therapy bullshit, because no, i don't want to talk to anyone about anything, nothing
any therapist could say it's going to help and that's how i've always felt whenever i've been sad and or depressed or whatever it's like
i couldn't do it to my family because my family would fall apart and i'm too scared to die anyway, because i i don't know how it feels, and it's too scary to me
i'm a rational and that's what summit you have to understand about people is that when they're in a certain frame of mind it's irrational, so they do something stupid like people that self-harm they do it because they just can't find another way to release, but something that would never meet like i'd
i'm i'm sorry that i feel this way, but i do i've wracked in my life by doing this because i put all my eggs in one basket
my some of my stupid negative thoughts
if i don't have him because nobody else knows me in that way, do you understand that no family member can do that? because it's just weird, i don't want to cry in front of my family and i don't want to cause them trouble god, i'm so sorry, but you had to see me like this, but i'm just so broken and the only way i'm gon na be put back together as if he he was stay with me, otherwise my whole life is over
there i hate everything about it
what's going like do something and i'm sorry i don't know what more i can save it
i don't care about anything or anyone except him, like he's all the mess right now and anything that anyone says to me, that's horrible! i just don't care because people are irrelevant, so people would hate on me
i've had it's actually like long-term and serious, and i kind of wish i never go into it in the first place, because of just how i feel right now, love hurts it sucks and you always think everything's going to be okay, but then it's not on there because everything comes crashing down, she been like this for the past month to be honest, but only it got really serious these past few days, because i decided to bring up why he's been acting so off and weird nia found out, i'm lost for words now, so i guess i'm just glad here but um, that's just what's going on right now and i just don't know what to do and myself, because i have no life outside of this relationship
if i was trying to throw my family just i'm, i can't exist there anymore
