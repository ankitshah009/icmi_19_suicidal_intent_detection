basically, what happened is like my whole neck muscles, just in my neck and in my shoulders just tightened up, i mean like this
i mean it was like a charley horse, but in my throat and in my shoulders is very very painful
it took me a few days before i could watch the footage and when i did, i realized how awful it sounded and how scary it was going through that person
i wasn't going to share it with you guys at all i mean it's a horrible video
i know that i'm not the only person that goes through things like this, and i don't ever want to be that person that just sits and thinks woe is me like
they'll come to you that was my computer, i'm having a really hard time talking
