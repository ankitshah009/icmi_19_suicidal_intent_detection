you might not think like the coolest thing, but no he's the kind of person who could just throw up a girl with one hand and just catch her and hold her in the air and do all the crazy flips
i know i can't do this to myself, but it's like, i could have helped him or something i could have given him money and spotted him for his medication
it was like the middle of the night, it was, i don't know it was after midnight, like 12:30 1:30, and they said they found his body and i just obviously broke down, and it's so weird, it's so weird when you have this person that you care about and you talk to them every single day and one day you just can't talk to them anymore
my stomach would just drop and i'd get so sad because i knew would never beat him again and i would call his voicemail just so
i always wanted to tell him that, but i never told him that and that's really difficult that i never got to say that to him and i, when i get depressed i can't eat like
i think my dad was on a business trip, so i was sleeping in the room with my mom and i remember waking up one morning i was so dizzy and i walk out to the living room to my mom and she looks at me and she's like what is wrong with you - and i was just like - i don't know, and she said that my face was white
it was really bad and it's not like
i don't know, but it wasn't open, casket funeral, and so it was just weird i just wanted to be by him, even though i know he's not in there
i just completely forgot it did that and it was really hard
might this is really weird to say, but he was being cremated after the funeral and just afterwards just thinking like he's no fire right now like he doesn't even exist anymore, he's just like dust, so freakin weird talking about this
so why waste your time - and i always pictured growing my audience on youtube - to reach a ton of people so that i could share this story and tell anyone out there if you've lost someone or have gone through traumatic things and you feel hopeless, it can get better and you can change your mindset and you don't have to be stuck in the depression from tragedy and even though it's sad that this happened and it hurts, and it's a huge part of my story and why
i can be it's so weird so weird to actually be making this video now, and i know i'm not expressing it exactly the way i wanted to, but i wanted to share this story with you, because it is why i make videos
i was debating monetizing this video because i'm like, i feel guilty making money off of this, because i you know i that's it just feels weird, but then i'm like one of my goals was always to make money to help people i've owned
i don't just talk about sad things in my life, usually but uh
