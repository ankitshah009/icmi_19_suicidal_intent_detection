i don't even know how i am crying because i feel like i have like no tears left, but i woke up from my nap and i expected to feel better
i expected to feel better, but i'm not i feel worse than before
i don't know if it's gon na be a bad thing, but i feel horrible
i feel like are nothing to know what i've been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, depression, anxiety and bipolar, so the moments that i am happy, it doesn't last long at all, but the moments that i'm sad and feel like killing myself
i mean that doesn't matter to me, it's just that they want friends to talk to
pat, you don't know this video says little to nothing about me about what i've been through right now
i can truly tell you that being alive sucks, it really does right now, as you can see, i'm laying my bet just feels like i have nothing to live for, so why not just go you know i can feel the tears like coming up, but they're, not you know like coming out because, like i said i just feel like i don't have any more left, there might be a little wetness like i just rubbed away, but i was anything that i literally have no tears left to cry
now i literally i'm shaking so bad
if i just went away, was it here anymore? what's not alive wasn't just sitting around doing nothing with my life
so i'm really just sitting on my ass doing nothing thinking about this type of shit
