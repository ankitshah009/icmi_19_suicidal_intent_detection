hmm, it's really difficult to write this because i'm incredibly weak it hurts to write and it hurts to breathe, it hurts see and it hurts to feel it hurts to be human
my head isn't screwed on straight, so excuse my writing a dad, even though, even through my imperfections, you stood by me through thick and thin
you've taught me so much and i'm sorry, i can't continue
i'm sorry mimi, i'm so so sorry
i'm so sorry
i've called you terrible things
i'm sorry
that's why it hurt me so bad when i saw you cry because you were always the strong one and seeing you weak affected me
depression is a horrible thing and you will get through this
i didn't understand, i didn't know how to react, because you pinned it on me when i was the one protecting you
so i wasn't i'm sorry
i'm sorry! i didn't listen as much as i wanted to
i'm selfish, i know, don't blame anyone, but johanna, please i'm sorry! i couldn't make it
