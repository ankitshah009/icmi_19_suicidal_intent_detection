i don't even care about black crowns like in trouble
the answer is always no, i'm still spaced out still don't really feel like i'm awake, and then i go
i know so well when i'm depressed, i can just tell exactly when my brain isn't working properly
ever again, and that this is the normal, this is where my head goes to naturally, and that every time i show how you're feeling better you're going to feel better again bits of life and i'm lying to myself, and this is how i should just naturally feel and i should just stop treading water and let go and give up and just fall down to this dark pit
no-one's natural state should be this bad, it's so bad, so bad! oh! this is when you know, you're depressed you just get nothing from anything i'll watch a tv show and i'll be like
but when i'm this bad, it's like taking a bath is just going to make me feel hot and bored going to bed is just going to make me lie in the dark
so that's why i did that yeah, i don't know it's just annoying when you're sitting under jock stuff is being my pain yeah, so i felt like drunk for the past four years of my life and they're like alright
i'm waiting, i'm just like what a waste of my life
the worst thing is when this kicks in in like a social situation and i'm just like glazed eyes, i give people nothing
i have nothing to give you i'm sorry
