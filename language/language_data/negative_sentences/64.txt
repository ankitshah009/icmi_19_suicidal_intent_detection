hey guys, so i have really bad lighting, so i'm really sorry, i'm not wearing any makeup or hair extensions or literally anything before we get into this video
if i cry, but i'm sorry, i cry moving on from that all my life
she tried to prevent me from doing everything my sister did like she basically took everything that my sister did and then all the consequences that she might have given my sister or try to maybe give my sister she threw it on me also, and basically i was on to go out kind of mentioned this in some videos in a video before, i think it was my mom, but i didn't really go into as serious
i can't do anything, nothing on mom
i mean i've gone i've spoken to the few friends i've had about this
i mean i guess he was, but it was a counselor that they gave us through the school
maybe you should talk to somebody like i've tried and i feel like honestly, i'm at a point where i don't know who else to talk to, and so i was never really allowed to socialize
i wasn't allowed to pretty much do a lot of teenagers did growing up and, of course, i couldn't have a boyfriend either so on lately with learning things about people and experiencing like fake friends and experiencing how guys treat women and i'm i'm just late with all of that and it sucks, because i'm not a point where mentally, i feel like i'm mature and should be in a relationship with a man that actually treats me right, but i've just been dealing with so many boys
that's all i'm sorry to like it
how do you just broke it? but it just fell, so i'm sorry if the position or lighting is different or whatever, but don't shelter
don't do all of the things that i just listed in fear that your kids going to die or that your kids going to end up with the wrong crowd, because, unfortunately - and i know this - i'm sorry if this sounds heartless
i'm sorry if this sounds horrible, but everything happens for a reason
some kids are peer pressured into things, but some kids also voluntarily choose to do bad things, and you have to realize that that is your kids decision
i couldn't do what i wanted to do and, as my sister got older, she for some reason became like a second mom, so it was like i had two parents
i don't have a reason to cry
my camera died again, so i had to change the angle again and i'm sorry
i don't really remember who i was, but i'm gon na try and go back to where i was talking about, then restricting everything i wasn't allowed to do what i wanted to do three years and i mean years i couldn't pick out what i wanted
i couldn't even go to someone's house for like two hours like that
she would ever only ever want to drive me places before i got a car that why wow most like 15 minutes away driving, like my mom, never wanted to drive me somewhere
it wasn't that she was tired
i would have started college, maybe like 18 turning 19, like that's, not bad at all, but that would have been if i had to
i can't handle both me as a person, i'm not capable of putting hours in a day, at least out eight hours a day to studying and doing the homework and doing stuff like that for school and then trying to put another 15 hours into creating and editing and thinking of content for my channel, i can't do that
i was told to not be myself, so i could get a piece of paper that would please other people i just i don't understand like i want so badly be able to be on my own, but unfortunately, even at this point in my life like if i go and i went and got like a minimum-wage job or even a job that paid me a little more than minimum wage
i know i need it, no, i don't want it, but this video, because i feel so bad because i know my family does watch my videos and i'm sorry like it
