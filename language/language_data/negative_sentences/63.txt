so i ended up making a video saying goodbye and i wrote one little letter saying that i'm sorry because my friend would find me dead
i was too drunk to hang myself, but i attempted it and i passed out well, i took the cord offers and i passed out from the bleeding, but i was sort of still awake, and so i stumbled my way up the stairs to my friends room and he was dead asleep because a heavy sleeper and i ended up knocking over a dresser with my feet, my legs
he was a drunk drunk, but he was drinking, so i could tell he was just hesitating to stay sober to get me to the hospital and then we drove there and on the way there
i think i was just because i was drunk then i can go really deep and on the way to the hospital, the er, my or i called my mom, and i was crying
