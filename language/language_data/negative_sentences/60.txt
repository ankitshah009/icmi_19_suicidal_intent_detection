how can i find a solution? how can i delegate, how can i cut certain things out? how can i prioritize what we tend to do? is we go? oh, my god, how am i going to do all of this stuff and we go into this emotional meltdown or we just feel angry or we just feel anxious or whatever it is
why is no one helping me or i couldn't possibly do all of this, i'm all alone
i can't and then feeling depressed or feeling, angry or feeling anxious or little thoughts like i shouldn't even be doing all these things anyway
