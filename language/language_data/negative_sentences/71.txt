i have this problem where, if i'm successful, i always find a way to bring myself down, because i don't think i should have that high of expectations in my life, like a really really good thing, happened to me last week, a massive thing out of this world
i can't what it is, i'm not trying to be that you two are saying that this students happening, but it can't tell you because they don't even know what's happening yet, but like this huge thing happened and i can't seem to like it anymore
the only reason why i'm doing it and i find them very hard on myself at the same time like i'm like, oh, i don't have like the packs of this guy and i think, like a lot, a lot there's a lot of stigma in men's health
i'm not asking for you to help me but, like i don't know, if you relate to this a comment down below yeah, so i'm really straight, i'm stressing about school everyone's like go, go, go and i'm like what is it for what, if i'm putting a hole to my career, what, if i'm taking a step backwards? what, if i get this this crazy opportunity and i'm stuck in school and then the other side of me is thinking like well, it's just school
actually i'll probably do it tonight, but i hate i don't clean anymore, because three people, three people came over to my place and they're like well, you clean and i felt really insecure and i'm not trying to be a hypocrite iii tweeted today and i was like i hate people who preach things that they don't do and, like i preach about being yourself, but i i don't know why
