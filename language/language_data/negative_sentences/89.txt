i didn't want to give any signals out there any idea of an horrible horrible thing to do to someone else, but just so other people could be aware that things like this happen
there was nothing i could do because i couldn't swim
i was trying to convince this man to take me back, so he tried for a whole 15 minutes and god must have been with me because it didn't go in
i also thank god that he didn't try to get aggressive back with me, because if he wanted to chase me or catch up with me, definitely couldn't have because he had longer less because he was taller but he'd be end up like actually passing me up, like
i couldn't see them no more, they were gone, they didn't wash up in the outside shower or nothing, i'm not sure if they went into the locker rooms, because at the interesting you can't really tell so i don't really know
if i told my sisters, i have to ask them, because i'm not even sure if i even told them i was just so hysterical, i didn't even called the police
i would have been on and called the police, but because he didn't i just hysterical
