you can't really explain how you get sad or why you get sad
i've been sad because you know um, and i can't really talk about this shit, which pisses me off um
i'm sad and i have to say the same thing over and over again and she doesn't quite understand, but she understands to an extent and i've noticed i'm sorry that i'm crying i'm sorry that i can't control myself, but this is a vintage ellie
this is me expressing my my feelings, um, i feel like i feel, like i'm, making dadeland sad
she says they're getting to her, but i feel like me, i feel like i can't talk
wears is wearing off on her and i feel bad and i feel sad because i would never want someone to feel the way
no idea, i don't know where to went to what i what else i want to say these videos on scripted um
i like that's, why my videos are so long because i, like being so wrong and uh one thing um
if weird, if we went through something terrible, we'll talk about it whatever, i guess, it really is tricking triggering her, and sometimes i just want to take that pain away, and just put it on to me, because i am the one that bit that is been living with this for ever so i don't know what else does it? i just wanted to
talk to you about it and, i know probably said the same thing over and over and over and over and over again and i'm sorry, i'm not looking into the camera i'm looking away because sometimes i just feel really weird looking into a camera and sometimes when i look away my my thoughts, can process better and i don't know, but how much know if there's something that you do or you something that you tell yourself or something that if someone's helped you through your depression and anxiety, what was it who was it? has it fixed you um? i know that this true that this doesn't go away
don't watch them because this is me, i'm broken and you don't really need to listen to someone
