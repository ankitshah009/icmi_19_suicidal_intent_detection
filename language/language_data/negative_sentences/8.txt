yesterday, from hawaii and baby wood was a experience trip so the last couple of days i've been really depressed and just felt horrible and not powerless about doing you know doing my goals and you know there's breast since years, so i decided to go on this trip because you know i know what this is do, so i felt like getting myself out of this state and you know what took like 12 seats
i crushed it up, put the powder in lemon juice, extracted it in an hour or something i filtered it then i drank it and you know i expected this trip to to make me super conscious and get me some confidence, and you know stuff needs to be stronger and bigger than the feelings coming off my from like a subconscious, because this is what i experienced that i do and when i landed trip kicked in
i had friends calling i have family, i do have love, so my life is not bad at all, but the way i live it and this emotional or habitual hamster wheel, is just really frustrating and and then just stuck in this habit in my head and can't get out of it and the more i frustratedly try to improve myself and do things right
the washes gets so one very bad thing is that you know i'm depressed since years because of personal conflict with a girl for another country that i met, and i felt if she can wrong with me and i still miss her
and while just talking my head for in a very long time, because i do i'm more interested in doing my own stuff instead of obeying having a job like a lot of times at home, which obviously an easy way of being depressed now, i want to do this youtube stuff - and you know like being depressed, it will get you that gets you in this hamster wheel of bad habit, self-medicating with something having a bad sleep, damn depressed again trying to make wheel, then it's just not that good on make one video than anyone
i didn't have a success on youtube, which makes me frustrated and makes me depressed again, and i just you know, hate the whole thing
then i end up doing nothing and i don't even take time to rest
i felt like i was sick
i said it kind of feels like watching a very, very bad movie in cinema and you're like i don't want me to watch this till the end
so what i did is i sleep on this two-person bed and i decided to sleep on another part of it because you know the day starts with waking up so at this i woke up the other part of it, so it was a little bit different
i decided to because of this i've not switch on my computer and waste time there, like it's a lot of time wasting when i just wish switched on my computer and and ended up twisting one or two hours just watching meaningless youtube videos
just let me know in the comment section you know i just wasn't in my phone wasn't doing meaningless stuff on the internet
