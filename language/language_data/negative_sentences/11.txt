so to start i just felt like i had let everyone down i felt like i was a problem to everything that was going on
i wouldn't be here to cause all this chaos in these issues and, like my parents, wouldn't have to pay for another kid and they would be like better off financially and they wouldn't my mom, wouldn't be so stressed out about me, and these were the thoughts that just kept going on in my mind, and i can't tell you how many times i repeated the phrase i don't want to be here anymore
she slept in my room with me every night because she was afraid i was going to hurt myself every night she slept in there, for i don't even remember how long like i want to say a few weeks to like a month or something just every single night because she was so afraid and then so, the crying happened a lot at first and then kind of after a while
i wasn't crying as much and i just didn't even want to get out of bed
i didn't go to school, for i can't remember so it was like two or three weeks, but i did not go to school because i just physically couldn't get myself to get out of bed
is this terrible place? i was just in this mindset of like i can't
i hadn't been on it in awhile, and these are a few of the things that i wrote in one post i had wrote, and this is the direct quote: how could anyone possibly love a girl that has nothing to offer and then another one from a few months later said, i don't think i'm meant to be here
i just i read that i fairly, i just people feel that now i was just really surprised that i didn't realize i was bad upset and i was in that state, maybe because i'm not there anymore, but i just i couldn't believe it and then just to think that that this is happening to people now, like people, feel this way now and it just gets worse
just to just to like show how upset and depressed i was now, i wasn't at the point where i was going to commit suicide
it crossed my mind a few times, but every time someone asked me if i was going to, i just said i don't think i could ever go through with it
i had seen someone else who diagnosed me with depression and i was put on medication and i had a really hard time with with medication, because it made me feel like there was something wrong with me like i knew i was this upset and i knew i was depressed but it made me feel like i was like screwed up like i was born broken and i i just didn't i i didn't want medicine at all, and i remember my mom saying if you were diabetic, you would take medicine for it right
