you could say i just wanted to make this video, because you know there may be someone else out there, who is feeling the same way as me, and even if this doesn't help you which, hopefully it does, but if this doesn't help anyone, at least, if you know you're not always feeling a hundred percent, then you're, definitely not alone in that so first off, i just want to say nothing like really bad has happened
nothing is working, so i guess i've just been feeling a little down
but then i just thought: what's the point in that, because it's almost like i'm just putting on this persona and that's character, and i'd only come on to this channel when i'm just going to be this super bubbly like person that just doesn't have you know any kind of negative emotions or feeling and um i've been kind of getting sick of just not filming anything, so i thought hey
so if you guys have been feeling in a slump or just not quite yourself feeling a little down, i just wanted to make this video to also share a few of the things that i've been doing that have really helped myself lately, every time we're feeling you know lost so every time we're feeling down every time when we're feeling sad, i feel like for most of the time we go out and we try to figure out what it is
so what is missing at this point? i'm thinking of the thing i've been searching for and what i'm looking for is me and as stupid as it sounds
so we have to really tap and when it comes to aligning myself of who i want to be and where i want to go in life, i'm realizing that to become this person, the in goal shouldn't be when i've got this apartment that i want when i live overseas and my dream location, when i have may dream career when all of those things might happen, that's not the answer of who and where i want to be in life, although i feel, like my mind, gets caught up with thinking that it is
i don't want to become all of this negativity as it's just going to keep tearing me down when you tell yourself that you're, sad or you're worthless, or whatever it is whatever it may be
it sounds stupid, but think about it
so i can focus on those instead of letting those bad things, i'm not so happy thoughts come in and this is so easy to do if you're lazy, like me and just don't, have a lot of time, but still want something like this to do
