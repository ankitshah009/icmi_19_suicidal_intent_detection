ehh, i mean don't don't even get me started
i had some terrible anxiety one week
i'm not hearing in the show! it's just it's it's dead air!! i checked the tune in stream and it's just silence! there's nothing there! i checked the short wave frequency, you know, where the radio station is supposed to be broadcasting it
and they said, you know, look we're dead in the water here! we can't even access any of the shows that we're supposed to air
and something happens, something doesn't go the way that it was supposed to go at all and could end up being a complete failure due to reasons totally out of our control
