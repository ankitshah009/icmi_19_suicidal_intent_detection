video not only because i want people to have a better understanding, but at the same time i really really want to make people think about the decisions they're making, because i know there's so many people out there that feel a lot committing suicide and so tempted
i should have done this video then, but i'm so busy with work
it's it's horrible and obviously having i had a tube in each arm
you can't move because you've got neither one each on, you know, you've got a catheter in in there and then we can do stare and think it's horrible
i failed in ending my life and i felt like a failure, because i've put myself in a position where they can see that i mean
you know i couldn't hold back the tears just looking at all of them, and you know i thinking sorry for what i've done
i can't forget, you know just sad shocked, hoping that i would pull through folks so uneasy
i felt bad for them
i felt like a disappointment for them
