what's really bothering me when i don't actively like talk about it, if i don't what go to therapy, which i haven't been able to get it there because he's still in fairfield, and you know with thanksgiving, he was gone two weeks and we haven't been able to run over time, my mother-in-law is only available on fridays, so i got a heating blanket so anyway, let me, let me tell you so i don't have somebody to like
you know that doesn't have some kind of head button so but she's an absolute fucking lifesaver, you know matthew would have been gone and you know if she was still living with her daughter like i'd, have to live by myself and that's not a terrible thing, and i could you know i could image to live by myself if forced to it's, not it's not a necessity that i have to live with somebody to be okay, but i know me and being alone 24 hours a day like it's not healthy for me and everybody is different, so you know people who are like well, you need to learn to stand on your own and you need to be able to do this
that's that's the end of that shit, but i don't want to hear that no more like i have been there
i have left an abusive horrible horrible relationship, a terrible, fucking relationship for me, like you have no idea what i went through with this relationship and managed to go to school, get my associates, degree pay my own bills and everything else
it was very bad bad
for me, that relationship was terrible for me
like i'm a pushing myself too hard, i mean walking too much me
i do absolutely nothing and i'm completely depressed, or i am manic and i'm ready to rule the fucking world and i don't want to stop and then, when i have those ups, it's called hot by mania
when i have those ups, i don't deal with anything and i started having that when matthew left and i went and visited my friends because i didn't want to be a sad sack the entire time and i didn't want to be miserable the entire time when matthew would call me so you know i forced myself to be up for him and for me i didn't want to be depressed
and i don't like to come on here and be like yes, i did this and that i'm hurt that it's awful its worst thing ever and when i wake up like i can barely move and when i'm trying to get down the stairs like i sit down and try to scoot down i'm like
these people have honest-to-god horrible diseases, and here i sit like why are you big, fucking fucking baby, and i am trying really hard not to think about the war
he doesn't talk about that stuff with me because he doesn't want to scare me hard, but people haven't worse
so when i don't deal with shit like this, when i do the one extreme or the other, what i don't actually work hard, whatever is bothering me, i have different kind of hitting attacks where i start shaking and my hands go numb and my lips turn blue and my fingernails turn blue and i can't feel my toes and i'm just shivering as hard as i could possible until my neck and my head is like busted
excuse me, i've had more water than i care to tell you, and i need to talk to somebody about it and i hate to unload it on somebody
i hate like this and i never want to unload this on my husband
and then it's just like that, like i started shaking violently and like everything turned blue and i was feeling a little sick and i went to obviously a hot shower and i feel better, but none of this is easy
i don't know anybody who's got all their shit together and i feel bad for every military wife that has to go through anything like this
you can't understand what it's like until you have to go through it, and then you have to figure out what the hell evening dave
she doesn't want to be on camera when she's not made up like she's, just like matthew that they don't really want to be on camera
that's not what she likes to do, so you guys only get little snippets and little pieces here and there like me, opening up her ice cream
