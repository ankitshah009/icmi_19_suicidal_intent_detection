i guess i've been doing this for a really long time, youtube and and the whole the whole thing and i've been avoiding this subject for the longest time
i don't want to do anything anymore, because what is my purpose, why am i here, you know and it got it got really really bad
why is this date still and - and it happened every single day to the point where it was extremely unhealthy? i wasn't eating well, i wasn't you know socializing, i wouldn't leave my apartment
