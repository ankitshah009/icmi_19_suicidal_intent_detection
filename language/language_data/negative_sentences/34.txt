hi, this is completely unplanned, i'm tired of my life, so i wouldn't say just recently, maybe like distant past, i don't know my life has gone down the drink
i feel like i've spun out of control and i can't do anything about it
like i hated my mom, i hated my dad my parents suck my brother was fake
oh, i would sit here and i'd be like oh, my god, like i'm in this position, because my mom treats me the way that i am i'm in this position, because i don't have any money which i mean money does play a really big role in a lot of you know what i'm saying, but you know there's boys work around that
