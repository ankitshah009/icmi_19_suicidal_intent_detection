i'm depressed, i feel hopeless, i'm lost i'm confused and - and i just i feel like there's something inside of me - that is just empty
why would i give advice to people? because i haven't been through anything my life that pisses me off because you're right, i haven't, i shouldn't be a motivational speaker, because i have never gone through tragedies in my life, for example, i've never been homeless, i've never been addicted to drugs and never almost lost
i just told you one of the darkest things about me, so why am i telling you all this? the reason why i'm saying this to you is because i'm trying to express to you where i'm coming from trust me, i don't want to depress you by this video, make you feel worse
i really fucked up and depressed because i can't figure out what to do so
listen i've been trying to figure out how to take this person inside of me and bring it out cuz
