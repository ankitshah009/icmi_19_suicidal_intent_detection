it was one of those feelings where i felt relief and, like i wanted to continue, and to this day i still cannot break the habit of whenever i feel sad or whenever i feel guilty or whenever i feel like i deserve it
i dressed like as if i was just home alone, and i just didn't care anymore
i felt like during christmas break, my boyfriend went on vacation and i felt like i had nobody, because he couldn't never talk
it was just gon na be gone, and i didn't have to worry about it anymore, so i decided that night to text my boyfriend
can release you, and so my head was like yeah, i'm not leaving my freaking house, i'm not leaving my house, and they told me that i didn't have an option and then i had to leave so i head out the door
my part two, i mean like the second part of this since i stopped filming, and i completely just forgot about the video for a hot second because he got like too sad at the moment
i love me: i'm not going to go into a lot of detail about what exactly happened between point a and point b being now, but i'm just going to tell you a few stories about the other suicide attempts that i've had the other times that i've been risky with suicide, so um anyways, i would play with everyone in my life, like a yo-yo, i'd push them away in hopes that they came back and then once they did come back, i'd push them back away, which is no que to do, and i'm still working on it, i'm still working on a lot of things
i felt, like i had already past due time that i was supposed to be alive because at the time is the last march, and i already passed the time that i felt like i needed to be dead
so with this um i would just stare at a wall, and then i'd asked to go to the bathroom, sometimes, and on occasions i there was at least five instances that i can recall that i was just walking through the hallways thinking
i walked around to the back of my school and i sat down behind the school and i texted all my family members that i was sorry
i texted some friends, some old friends, telling them that i was sorry because in my head i was going to do it
i picked it up and i started to put it around my neck and took myself with it until i couldn't breathe in my head was going up, it took too much effort and the string was not as hard to pull
it was extremely hard to pull and it was extremely hard to get around my entire neck to pull hard enough to actually strangle myself
it meant a lot to me that you guys were there one time i was in school and in spanish class it was really bad
i guess you could say where these attacks, i completely start laughing and i can't stop laughing [ music, ], [, music ], because all i'm thinking about it's just solely death
that out is never cutting and that out is never any type of self-harm or any type of anything
