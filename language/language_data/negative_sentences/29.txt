i feel just terrible and in this video i just want to explain how i feel i just want to be real
couldn't have been better really and i got home a couple of hours go and i just you know, broke down, i it's difficult for me to even begin to tell you how i'm feeling right now
but i want to feel like i'm helping you and when i make a video like this
i i'm just expressing how i feel, and i don't want to push my feelings onto you so once again, i'm so sorry i feel like i've, let my girlfriend down
i feel like i'm a failure, because i feel this way and i don't know i don't have any answers as to you know, to stop feeling this way
i just can't get the thought of it out of my head he's just running through my head 24/7
i know it's the wrong thing to do and it's it's a horrible habit
it's disgusting, it makes me feel crap
i didn't want to show anybody how i'm feeling on camera like this, it's i feel ashamed again and i'm so sorry, i just i'm not doing this for attention before people start coming in
you know come on just stop feeling depressed, just shut the up too, because you don't want to talk about your talking like the crap, you just you can't just snap out of it like that, and you know people who suffer and watching this you'll know exactly what i'm on about you can't just snap out of it if wanted to snap out of it, don't you think i would would have done that by now, instead of just feeling like you know how i feel right now, i feel like people are walking over me and they're just spitting on me: that's how low i feel and think about myself like look at my top, it's like ripped and i don't even care like i'm on camera
of course i do, but there is no shame feeling this way and i feel so sick
i just feel terrible
i'm sorry i'm rabbiting on and rambling on, and this is a boring video and none of you probably care or want to watch this anyway
so once again, i'm so sorry that i've made this video
