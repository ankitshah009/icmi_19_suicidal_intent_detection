i've been smoking nigga, i don't even smoke son, but at this point honestly at this point my eyes, i was like fucking fuck it
why does it matter? i feel so fucking numb son and it's like my first time trying to do this video, it's like to 201
it's like my fourth time trying to do this, i'm just like fucking yo
somebody talk i'm just driving driving on like a two-lane road and i see like a big truck coming and i just think like man, i should just fucking swerve in that lane and i just initiate, and i i never tell my by that shit in person
all the time like nasa's fuck, i should just i should just die sighing i wish i was
i wish i could just fucking die
how i sayed and i've been saying even and it happens to my fucking brothers like, and it's just like, knowing now knowing how that shit feel son, how that shit hurt hurt me seeing the hurt on my my family now i can't do that shit like even if i wanted to i'm not gon na do it, i can't do it not now i'm fucking stuck here and met whether i, whether i like it or not, my negative, it's not even about me son, it's bigger than me
i mean i, i know i know i can't do now
i know i don't know man, something probably just wrong with me
what's wrong with me man, i know i can't do it
i know i shouldn't do it, i'm not gon na do it, but i do have thoughts of doing this shit, but i saw my brother today and i can't even explain how that shit felt
i can't explain how he looked: it's just whole family just crying, and i was the last one to get there
i said i'm just numb, i'm just numb being around everybody else
i think i just i'm just fucking bawling and i'm crying my fucking eyes out and i get back in my bed and i'm crying, but when i get around other people i just it's like, i can't do it fuck, even if i wanted to do it
just talking he's just like out he's just telling you like man, i don't understand why you got it so hard
why is this? why did shit happen to me? if i was happen to our family, i wouldn't what the fuck did
niggas old everything happens for a reason i just just based off the shit that already be happening already happened to me, because i already feel sorry for me
people i already was looking at me like dan upside, got a lot and then got a lot going on son being homeless and shit like my nigga side, and he just feel sorry for me
i can't even he couldn't look at me
i'm not taking my life even though fuck it i'll flash everything matter, but i can't do this, even if i wanted to me i'm fucking stuck here, i'm not about to put my parents through that shit, i'm not by putting my other siblings
after all this time like i can't, but not one everything's for him, so i'm do not shit for him
i always thought it wasn't really selfish, but it is
