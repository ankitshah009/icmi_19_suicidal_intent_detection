this is destroying me, i i don't even feel like i'm living
it feels like the only thing i can do is be on the computer for about 20 minutes
i don't know anyone who's come back from from four months of this i mean what's left of me, even if i get it together, i can't stop thinking of suicide
i can't stop worrying
i can't i can't make that happen, because i i can't even get out of bed
i just get worse and worse and worse, i keep giving me medications and they don't seem to do anything
they just make me tired and just make me out of it, and i just stay in bed all day next to a space heater in a dark room
i pray that no one else has to go through this, but no one else ever has to feel feel how low this is
