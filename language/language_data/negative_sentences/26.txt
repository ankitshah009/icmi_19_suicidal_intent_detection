that's if somebody ever watches this - i don't know, but the thing is that um i've been going through a really tough time these past ones
i was just so weird and like i have the weirdest example, the only one up that pops to my head right now is that when i was like 11, my friend from school from my class, we were walking home from school one day and he started smoking and i was this little innocent girl, 10 11 years old and i was like and my anxiety kicked in and i didn't know it was anxiety then so i was just paranoid for the rest of the day because i thought that i would know like
since i was like 12, i knew something was wrong with me depression
i didn't really know i was depressed until like a year ago because, like i said i always knew there was something wrong with me
i guess and like i can to finish these things, i started and i feel horrible like the most heartbreaking
so when i do feel, though i just don't go out at all, because i don't want people to see me that way, so when things got serious, people didn't really believe it
it annoys me so much that i can't be stable, like i'm always up here or down here like it got to the point where this summer i couldn't get out of bed and then my mom was like
just been going down and i started drinking a lot, i have alcoholism in my family, it runs up in the family and i started drinking every single night and partying a lot, and i was just drinking because i, like the feeling of going to sleep, it was easier to go to sleep my mind wasn't like [, music ]
thinking like it was just easier to fall asleep and drink yourself to the state or you're numb, and you don't feel anything you're not having these thoughts
i probably ought to sleep at like 7:00 in the morning and my friend came over stayed the night wrong with that
i woke up so drunk at 3 o'clock in the afternoon the next day and i just felt so pathetic
like i said i it makes me feel worse that i am
i just wanted to end this and i tried there was no wine at home, except this one bottle
i thought that was my rock bottom, but when i woke up to my mom freaking out crying, she found me on the floor and she was just like hysterical and i [ music ] had not thought about if it failed, but that happened, and that was heartbreaking to see my mom there [ music ] and they made me throw up, then i was just watched 24/7
i don't know how it all works and i never thought i would be in this position because i don't know, there's nothing wrong with my life
i guess like something has to be wrong or something has to happen or you go through some trauma or something to end up like me, but it's just mental disease, really there's nothing
i was just crying at night for no reason like sometimes when i went to bed
i just started bawling and i had no reason i just felt so low and my boyfriend at the time was trying to comfort me and he was like, of course he was like what's wrong, what's wrong, i just started making up something because i didn't know myself and that's been happening for years now and nothing happened to me
if that makes sense, because at the state i was something was going to happen like when i was out partying or like, i was sure i would have done something so stupid and something i would regret for the rest of my life and they were just like making me realized that i am only 21 and i have my whole life ahead of me, although i feel or felt like a fuckup and like i had messed up my life and couldn't or wouldn't do anything with it, they reassured that it's just beginning really
i don't know if i'm even gon na post this, but i can't really imagine what's going to happen
if i do anything stupid, if i do anything wrong - and she just is so good for me - and she helped me through all of this - she helped me accept that i have a problem and i need to work on it because i i just hold stuff in and when we have been friends for a few months, i went through some stuff that i'm not going to talk about
but i didn't because i just hold stuff in and i just that's how i've been all my life and she really helped me open up and accept things that are happening and made me realize that i have to deal with them or else something like this is going to happen - and i just yeah - i just don't know what i did to deserve - that person
like then i came, and i was like why you talking to my dad
i heard him say like: is there anything i don't know like? what doesn't he just ask me like? i was just like it was crazy, so she was like stop this to me for a second, my mom was working a shift you're on that
