do you know? i have friends, don't get me wrong, but i'm just saying this: it ain't me, you know what i mean the ones because of the language
you know what i mean, i'm still going through, that i don't know they might know, but i'm mentally though i have major depression, i mean so you're not trying to take medicine for that, but that just seemed like that
just gets worse
like me, we got ta suffer, you know, we don't have happiness, we don't have mom and i'm not saying i'm not happy like i'm the worst person in the world like as bad as i can be, but i'm just not i'm mad because i'm not where i thought i would be at 27, i thought i would be much further know what i am
i had a real bad day and i was just like: what's the point man like, what's the point of living his life like i, i was like fuck, this shit man
you know saying like i can't work at the type of job that i would like to work at, and you know i can't find the type of relationship that i want
so my thing is just like: what's the fucking point, you know i mean my nigga like like
you found sad now i don't even see myself getting 40
