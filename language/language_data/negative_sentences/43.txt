i had a supervisor that knows shit about it, not even in the textbook context, but you want to tell me how to do my job
if you don't know how to do the job leave people alone, because at the end there's a what happens when that person leaves you see, i was the only it for the past six years, so you replace the body
excuse me, stuff somewhere monday through friday from 7:30 to 4:00, is not conducive to what i want to do with my life
