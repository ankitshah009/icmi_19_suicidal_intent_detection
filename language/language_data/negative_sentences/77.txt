i didn't care that people disliked me, but i didn't want to give people another reason to have something to say about me, which is why i pretty much waited till
i graduated to start high school and that's really terrible
oh today is my birthday and i am in a terrible mood and it's not to be because i know some people would think that see that it's like it's your birthday, like some people, don't even live to the 18 year
now i used to be very bad, but i'm not there at all
i've decided i'm going to college a semester late, i'm not taking a gap year, but i need to go uh semester late because i went to school
i never got to do driving school and that wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that i'm moving out
you know driving school, the car isn't the issue for read the driving school is the issue, so the sooner i could start driving school because i am not living close to my parent
