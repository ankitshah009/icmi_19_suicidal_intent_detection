i just i'm a happy bubbly person, you know what i'm saying and that's one thing i want to say
y'all know me, as the goofy, the goofy motherfucker, who, who make everybody else, laugh deep down, i'm hurting on the inside
so if you got a friend, that's always making you laugh or anybody else laugh around around you or anything like that
if you have a friend like that man check on them, because they not all right, they not okay, you know, i'm saying it's always the goofy, the goofy quiet wise
you know what i'm saying check on check on them check on y'all our peoples, man, they not! okay, man and i feel for them it's just like when you walk around with y'all, hey trying to hold your head, i feel like making other people who laugh and happy man
that was like that's kind of like it's kind of like a stable thing for depression
i don't know why, but it seemed like all the goofy people, all the comedians and all the comedians
they really be depressed as fuck like robin williams
he was an on-set
i don't know him
you plan on a movie mr
doll, fair and other classics, and i'm saying i can't really thinking on top of my head
no, i can't really thinking off the top of my head
only thing that came to my head was miss out her and he was a famous comedian
he killed himself suicide and i feel like people, don't take people, don't a depression, serious enough until it's too late
you know what i'm saying until it's too late and every time i think about him, like you know what i'm saying i feel like he really made other people laugh and smile, but this nigga really was hurt and he really was hurt

he actually want me to come down there visit just you know, sancious be around be around somebody
you know i'm around jazz, but it's just like that'd be like a breath of fresh air just going down to another state, and just you know just hanging around somebody
you know, i know that shit might sound weird, but it might sound weird because y'all fracking blood y'all, you got just a nigga round, but it's different when you'll be around somebody 24/7 like every day
there's nothing bad about it, but it is
it feel good to get a knob some breath of fresh air
