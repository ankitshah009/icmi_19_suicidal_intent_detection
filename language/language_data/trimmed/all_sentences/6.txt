so tired of the person - i am so here's the deal
first of all, i'm wearing my hat
most people, don't like my hat cuz they say, makes me look like a dude, but you know what i'll just put on makeup later: okay geez! so i am about to go to take care of someone's dog with my mom, so i'm not going to film because i plan on not ever filming my parents to give them their privacy
oh yeah, i'll, be back, stay warm and toasty
what kinda looks like a bomb hot, so it appropriate? i'm just gon na be real, quick with you guys, i'm feeling pretty pretty horrible right now, no, i'm not suicidal, so no one needs to freak out
even if anyone were to freak out
i don't know if you guys, would i'm really just at a mindset where i just don't want to be here right now that doesn't necessarily mean i'm suicidal okay, i don't like stuff right now
i can't find happiness very easily
i can in this guy
so that's! okay, hello: this is not nice
can you say hello, mister yeah, he's about the only happiness i could find and stuff
i didn't want to record this at first, because i've gotten a lot of crap before from people just saying that crying it
you know this is weak and that i do it too much and i'm so tired of being like this
it's so tired of the person i am problem is i don't i'm not gon na kill myself, but i think about it all the time
this is really embarrassing that this is the second like daily vlog that doing and i'm already crying
i just wanted to show people that, like the realness behind depression and anxiety and just how much that it sucks and how much it just takes up your life greetings
so the mood has definitely changed since my last little clip i kind of just didn't vlog for a little bit because right after the last thing, i just talked to you guys about
i went to therapy and i had a really really really nice talk about everything that i was feeling felt, really good and confident afterwards and then my i immediately went back home, so my dad and i could go see a movie and in the movie is called captain fantastic, i think that's what it's called yeah fantastic, that should be it and it has viggo mortensen in it
aka aragorn, which we all love, and i really liked it and it just kind of opened my eyes to a lot of stuff and alright we're gon na, take our short break
okay, sorry anyways, i'm having a little bit of camera trouble
i don't even remember where i left off honestly
basically, i'm feeling better, i'm here at the doggies house, so that we can take it for a walk and i'm gon
na be honest, though, i'm feeling pretty insecure about my weight at the moment, especially when i make these vlogs
i can because i have this little: u finder at the top, and it just lets me see my face and it's just not making me feel too great
but what will make me feel great
is this cute little doggy, which you'll see in just about 20 seconds, or you know what i did it so we'll be like two seconds for you guys thank you
he says paying me of a poopy woman
well, as long as then all over the place, but not to go for a walk, you can tell it's
the proof is i'm wearing my tennis shoes, my nice nikes, it's late, it's the kind of dark out already, but i need to get done
i need to feel good about myself because i've just been feeling really up and down all day and i'm so sick of it feel like a hormonal pregnant woman
i might as well just tell people i'm pregnant because i gained all this weight
is my excuse
like oh jj, uh? oh you, you look good, oh it's because i i'm pregnant yeah who's, the father, otten! there's, none! no yeah! yeah! that's a good idea! right! yeah! this is more thinking yeah anyway, i'm gon na go
do my walk all right, i'm going i'll, see you guys, smile love, you guys too, the ones i actually watch things bye
