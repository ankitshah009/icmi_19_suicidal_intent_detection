i need to share this story of what happened to me and something that has impacted my life every single day, since it happened five years ago, one of the people i cared about in the world the most um
this is when it gets hard
it took her own life
this is why i haven't been able to film it
this is coming from somebody that has had those thoughts, somebody that has had to get a lot of help because of having those thoughts
i'm not gon na tell the story of how it happened or what happened, because i don't think it's fair to her and i don't think it's fair to me and i don't think it's fair to you guys, but i just kind of want to sit for a little bit and talk about what it's like, after what it's like, leaving the people that love you behind, even when you feel like nobody loves you, because it sucks the way that i've described losing a friend to suicide is basically when you love somebody, you give them a little piece of your heart and when people break your heart i mean you eventually get that little piece back
you find that piece and you're able to kind of mend your heart, but when you lose a friend to suicide, especially you don't ever get that little piece back
it's like this empty little hole in your heart that eats away at you forever
it's always confusing, and it doesn't make sense, and i know how she was feeling before she took her own life, because i've been in that place where i thought that was an option, and i thought that was something that would make things better
and i thought that would just fix all my problems and i it doesn't use everybody that you care about with so many more
i guess all i can say to somebody that's contemplating any in their own life
is that you can't, i didn't feel like you
can i know you feel like it's gon na fix everything i know from my friend
i can't even imagine the amount of pain that she went through before she decided to make this decision this permanent decision that can never be taken back and i'd suck at first
i didn't believe it was real
i spent a lot of time convincing myself, it wasn't real and it didn't happen and then, for a long time i was angry because the friend that was always there for me
it wasn't there for me through this
they weren't, even here it's like the worst heartbreak ever because it can't be fixed
i know before she entered her own life, she felt like nobody loved her and that nobody was going to love her
it's not true
when you take your own life, you rob yourself of all these people in the future that want to love you and want to know you and want to be around you
when you take your own life, you don't even give it a chance
you don't give it a chance to get better
you don't give these people that are waiting for you that you haven't even met a chance to love you, you don't give happiness a chance, and i understand how hard it is
i have been there and i've had those thoughts and i've had to get help for those thoughts and it's the hardest thing
it's the hardest thing to try to convince yourself to stay alive when you feel like the only option is to end it
but i promise you, i absolutely promise you that it's worth it and that it does get better, even if it feels like it does, even if you feel like you're stuck and you're gon na feeling forever
it's not true, because people are just gon na miss you
so much and they're gon na miss you forever
i know if you're in that position that this sounds like a load of shit
i know because if you would have told me when i was going through that that i would have the friends i have now and i would have this chosen family that i didn't even know could exist
i wouldn't have believed you
i would have thought it was a load of crap
i would have thought everyone was completely bullshitting me, but it's honestly, so true is, if you are in the position, when you were so heartbroken by the world, that you think you need to take your own life
it means you have a heart that is so full of pain, which means it can be so full of love
it means that you're somebody that feels a lot and loves a lot, and it's a disservice to the world to leave
if you're one of those people, you think that ending your own life will make things better, but in reality it just makes this dark world a little bit darker
when we need it your light, my life was so much brighter with her in it, and i still convinced myself that she's out there and that it didn't happen and that she's just quietly living a life where she's happy but she's, not she's, not here anymore
