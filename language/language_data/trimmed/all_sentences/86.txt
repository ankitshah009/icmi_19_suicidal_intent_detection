i really felt like there are people that will look past your appearance and that's order right
there are people out there who will past how you look, and we will be with you even if you're unattractive, and it doesn't even matter to what degree of unattractive you are because there will be girls that will not really care
the problem is finding them, which is the i would say that depends on the country if you're in a country with extremely lots of tourism, extremely good economy, everyone are decently rich, like everyone are decently, beautiful
all that maybe it's time to look into future plans and move to another place where you can find more unattractive people, because that's sort of what you want anyway
this girl - and i was friends a few weeks and whore - were well friends with benefits, and then we sort of broke contacts and stuff
she was one of those people that were like i get bored of people easily, so it was like yeah
so we didn't really stay friends anyway, after after that time i sort of got really annoyed of being alone and my ex wanted to come come and visit me
the girl
i was with for all those years that treated me so bad and i was so weak
so i said: okay and i spent another free or it was about four years
i've spent seven in total, we first, so it was about three more years with her and those here, sorta improved quite a lot
there were a lot better than the first three years
so it wasn't that bad, but it didn't work out because i was so unhappy
i was extremely unhappy i felt like we had nothing calm and she was always angry
moping complaining and she didn't feel good and i didn't feel good
we were just tearing each other down and i couldn't forget all all the things in the past and like we had nothing in common except just being angry on each other, so we broke up and with that was about five months ago now and i move past everything quite easily so, one month ago, after we broke up, i started to try and date again and the bombardments of you are ugly or not
my type was so unreal
i can tell you a few things that i've been through
i've met people that are extremely girls that are extremely overweight and don't look well as a well as well, and they tell me you're, not my type you're way too ugly or dim
they make up an excuse like
oh you didn't text me the same day
i can't be free, i can't have you as a contact and they'd do anything to get rid of you and then there was this time when i had a date with a girl, and i had spent lots of money on making a perfect day together, like i had setup everything perfectly and i went on the subway over an hour and i stood on the train on the train station and i looked for her for two hours before i was like
okay, she gave up and then i went home and she wrote that when she saw me i was so ugly
she didn't have the encouragement to talk to me and now i made an algorithm for a site
that's like tinder, but it's called pado
it's like tinder
pretty much where i automatically love every person, no matter who it's like a special algorithm for a program that i made so that i click a button and it likes 600 people every day which was double limit, and it's i've done that for over 10 days
so that's i know easily it's over 6,000 people that i have liked on that side like like and wants to write with
no, i'm not a single one has responded, not a single one, even though i put on the best photos, i can find not a single soul wants to reply or write or give it give a person like me a chance
so where am i standing this alright? now extremely depressed, extremely sad feeling like giving up, i have sort of given up a lot on many things and all these events, through the years have made that i haven't been able to live a normal life, because my friends were commenting on me
