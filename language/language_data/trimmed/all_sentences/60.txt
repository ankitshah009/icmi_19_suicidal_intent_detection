i cannot deal with this
i cannot do this
i i'm just gon na give up or i'm just gon na crawl into my cave or i'm just gon na sit in this foggy haze forever and told something happens
so that is very, very possibly the defining factor of the issue that actually contributes, and primarily to that experience of feeling overwhelmed
that emotional aspect, that we keep attaching to these things, the emotional approach that we have to the issues, the the problems, the challenges and the tasks that we are faced with so solution is quite simple: drop those emotional experiences, meaning that, okay, why are they being triggered? why am i feeling powerless? why am i feeling helpless? why am i feeling anxious? why am i responding in this way when i can see that it's not effective? it's not supportive, rather than just keeping it practical, just dealing with things as they come and looking at my responsibilities in a more objective way, so go through that process of investigation of all of these emotional attachments that have crept in to this thing
that has now become feeling so overwhelming feeling so overwhelmed, but in conjunction with that, what is important and what is really more part of the living solution is whenever we get to that point of feeling overwhelmed or feeling i can't deal with us all
those little thoughts start creeping in
why is no one helping me or i couldn't possibly do all of this, i'm all alone
i can't and then feeling depressed or feeling, angry or feeling anxious or little thoughts like i shouldn't even be doing all these things anyway
you know it's not even my problem
why am i making this my problem? things like that that start creeping in those are the points where we need to immediately apply correction, where we need to practice that self-awareness of okay, i'm having this thought - and i know where the sport leads
i know this particular thought is going to take me eventually to that experience of feeling overwhelmed, so i'm gon na stop this thought
now i'm going to change how i'm looking at this situation, how i'm approaching this situation, i'm going to change how i'm dealing with it within myself, so that this experience or feeling overwhelmed doesn't build and build and build and get to that point of explosion or implosion
so, for example, my point of practicing correction is in these moments, where i feel overwhelmed: [ music ], i'm going to rather make it to-do list, prioritize the to-do list and start working through each point step by step and not let myself stay in that hazy
experience where i become less effective, because what that does is actually then accumulates onto the experience of feeling overwhelmed, because i'm not getting the things done that i need to get done at least not in the way that i know i'm capable of so i i need to be strict with myself about going into that haze, and i need to be strict with myself about practicing a more effective way to deal with my responsibilities
yes, maybe some of them i might need to put aside for now in terms of maybe they i just literally cannot get to everything
i need to consider that, so those are all of the practical considerations that i need to me joey
what are you doing? he's back, okay, i'm gon na in the video now before this gets ugly
all right, if you have any questions comments or i he just turned my computer on or you'd like to me - to expand on anything or anything like that
please let me know you can see in the dark message or leave a comment
