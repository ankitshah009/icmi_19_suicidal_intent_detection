hey what's up guys and girls, my name is danielle and welcome to my youtube channel and this title is kind of based, on my view really of this realization
yesterday, from hawaii and baby wood was a experience trip so the last couple of days i've been really depressed and just felt horrible and not powerless about doing you know doing my goals and you know there's breast since years, so i decided to go on this trip because you know i know what this is do, so i felt like getting myself out of this state and you know what took like 12 seats
i cut off the outside part of it
i crushed it up, put the powder in lemon juice, extracted it in an hour or something i filtered it then i drank it and you know i expected this trip to to make me super conscious and get me some confidence, and you know stuff needs to be stronger and bigger than the feelings coming off my from like a subconscious, because this is what i experienced that i do and when i landed trip kicked in
i kind of experience
instead of this, i experienced just absolutely hate anger, and you know frustration and this realization that my life is shit, just disculpa little doll enjoy and and - and i felt like i just want to live - leave things behind everything
the way i do things because it just gave me frustration, i just do things badly and i really need to change because i'd only enjoy my life
even if i kind of bushes myself that you know i do and i'm you know improving myself and going in the good direction, i don't so just some things are things that i hate in my life
well, okay, the good thing is i'm healthy
i can only one hundred years and i had the potential to change
i had friends calling i have family, i do have love, so my life is not bad at all, but the way i live it and this emotional or habitual hamster wheel, is just really frustrating and and then just stuck in this habit in my head and can't get out of it and the more i frustratedly try to improve myself and do things right
the washes gets so one very bad thing is that you know i'm depressed since years because of personal conflict with a girl for another country that i met, and i felt if she can wrong with me and i still miss her
but i gave her a lot of hate for wrong in me and actually never wants to see me again, which makes me feel sad
but at the same time i hate her because i can't forgive - and this kind of made me depressed - and this part is very logical - and you know you're expected to get over things
and while just talking my head for in a very long time, because i do i'm more interested in doing my own stuff instead of obeying having a job like a lot of times at home, which obviously an easy way of being depressed now, i want to do this youtube stuff - and you know like being depressed, it will get you that gets you in this hamster wheel of bad habit, self-medicating with something having a bad sleep, damn depressed again trying to make wheel, then it's just not that good on make one video than anyone
i didn't have a success on youtube, which makes me frustrated and makes me depressed again, and i just you know, hate the whole thing
waking up procrastinating a lot of times
i stopped cleaning and watching youtube videos or wasting time on the internet meaningless, stuff waste time
on my phone, then i you know, i can't bullshit myself that i try to improve my life
then i end up doing nothing and i don't even take time to rest
you know meet friends, so it's just the whole thing is absolute garbage and it doesn't work at all
