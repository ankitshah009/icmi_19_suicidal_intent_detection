i just can't take this anymore, my school hates me people more people want more people want me dead and more people hate me more people, everyday, it's just driving me
i can't take all this hate nor this pain on me
so by tonight i want to die
i don't want to be here
this pain is just way too much for me to handle it's harder and harder for me everyday
it isn't easy
russian is very hard
it's hard on you, you and it's hard on people around you
i know if i'm not here, people would be more depressed, but i rather be gone than to be living in this freakin hellhole
it's not easy at all
i just hate my life because nothing goes right, anymore
the people i want the most money just now, even though you are in depression
sometimes it can get better and sometimes it can get worse right now, i'm at my breaking point where i'm mourning to die and morning telling myself even more than our once some people can handle it
some people can't, and i'm i'm one of those people that can't handle it
