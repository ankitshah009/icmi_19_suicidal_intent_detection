my dad never came, he stayed in new york, can't say i blame him, but that that might be a factor as to how i am and why i am the way i am today so anyway move to delaware with my mom and her new job
that was probably where things got the toughest for me at six years old
i spent a lot of time alone, a lot of time alone and i then started to kind of get into more creative things like drawing and reading, and i became very independent because i had to be
i learned to cook to clean, to do my hair to dress myself to do everything if you've ever watched the movie matilda
besides the leak, the obvious superpowers and the siblings - and you know the iii was matilda, so i did everything alone and you start to gain a sense of independence and at the same time, you start to become very untrustworthy
you start to, you know, be become very comfortable in your aloneness, so it was very hard
i would say, to make friends and have meaningful connections with people, because i didn't know that you know um, i didn't have any siblings and i didn't really
it wasn't very
very close to my family, and so when it you know when i started school, i was that awkward child that didn't know how to have friends that are creative kid that was always drawing
i was very quiet, extremely shy
it was terrified to talk to anyone to the lunch lady
i couldn't order my lunch
i couldn't do a lot of normal things, because i was scared um
i was really scared
i was always scared that my mom would leave me
i was very scared
if you alone, i thought i was chopped it um
she didn't look like anyone in my family
it was just it's not a good space for a child growing up and you know kind of developing their ideas of the world and how they see it and how i thought it was just a scary place and don't trust anyone and don't you know
so don't that's literally my don't don't do this? don't do that you'll fail you'll! you know that's not what you're much to do and and brown girls are about to succeeded, we're not smart and all of that type of stuff that you learn at a young age and by the time i got to high school, i started to realize that
okay, maybe there's something in this and in this aloneness and you know i started to get friends and you know, make real connections with people after i started to realize that they're, not as scary as i thought they were, and people aren't trying to hurt me and it's okay too, to trust other people and so yeah
i started to get you know my friends and i started actually taking art classes and things like that and kind of trying to see what it is that i want to do with my life, because when i was younger, i always thought i would be a lawyer and i still, i still almost regret it not doing it, because i just have a passion for research and in law and helping people and and all that kind of thing, and so anyhow, that's when i started to realize
okay, i am different and that's all right
you know um after high school and in mind you i
i was the kind of kid where i i didn't do not say i didn't do well in high school, but i didn't think it was important and i still sorry and all the high school it was out there
and maybe you shouldn't listen to me, but it wasn't that important um
i kind of skim by
i got a trouble, a lot i was suspended, often just for i wasn't a violent kid, but i i was very opinionated and i had a lot of opinions about a lot of different things and i would let my teachers know it, and so i'd get kicked out often, i'd be suspended out of school suspension, in-school suspension - i i was pretty much an average student
i didn't do any of the homework i didn't believe in homework
i couldn't concentrate on my homework and but i did very well on the tests, because i kind of did that outside research and i kind of i really paid attention while i was in class
i just didn't want to carry that on once i left class
