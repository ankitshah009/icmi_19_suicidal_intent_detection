one thing i've learned is that we can chase the thing we want to the other side of the world and getting it may not make us happy
since i've been in india, i've there's it's been wonderful, it's been awful, it's been wonderful, it's been challenging
it's been amazing, it's been absolutely horrible and, and just incredible all at once, you know and i've been feeling a lot of frustration recently kind of like it's questioning like
why am i here? why am i really here like? what am i meant to be doing to be learning like what is this growth supposed to look like i mean i guess i could never know from the start
you know you never know setting onto the journey what the journey is going to contain, but i have just been feeling a lot of like frustration and confusion and just it's like searching for
i don't know what, but it hurts not having it do
you know what i mean so so far
i've been in india now 19 days
i spent six days in udaipur eight days in the desert, and then you know a couple days in transit here and there i'm in mumbai
today i photographed a wedding here last night, which was really beautiful
i didn't make a vlog during the weddings i didn't feel was appropriate, but now i kind of regret it
but now my plan is to head down to goa and i know i'm just still wandering and i'm still searching and i may not
you know i may not find what i'm looking for there
but then again i don't really know what i'm looking for all all
i can do is just you know, move forward and do my best to listen to my gut
you know listen to that voice within, even though it's very conflicted right now, but you know, i think people look at me and they think that i just have is like amazing, happy journey all the time, but i don't you know i really don't
this journey is like complicated, so the only thing i can do is just keep moving forward and trust the process and trust the journey and trust in god
if i'm to assume that i'm on a spiritual journey, then you know all of this is part of that and that's beautiful and i surrender to it, and i embrace it check out this incredible beautiful view
i have right now
this is the hotel in mumbai where i'm staying
i stayed one night, my friend prakash milani from singapore, put me up here or let me crash with him
it was such an oasis
it was such an oasis in my trip and just really amazing, i'm really enjoying how clean it is
but now i'm heading back out into the i really i don't have any desire to stay in mumbai
i just i just want to
i just want to get out of here and just move on to the next thing, all right journey on journey on fellow travelers,
