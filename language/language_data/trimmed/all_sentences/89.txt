is that traumatic to me about how to if i'm gon na tell the story all the way i have to get into details, so he started filming down there with his hands and stuff, and it's really hard like even to just get the words out
it's like really difficult for me, so just bear with me, so he was putting his finger on a place
you'd like you, got ta kind of over me and it's hard, but i'm saying something like i am now like
i know what it feels like to be choked up, because that's exactly what i'm experiencing right now not today, not today, i'm not gon na cry
look anyway, you got to fill in places with his hand and stuff, and he pulled my swimwear over to the side
oh, i, like you guys, i i just feel like i'm gon na melt right now, like it's like i'm reliving the moment telling me, but i'm only going to tell this just so you guys can be aware of these types of people so um he moved my swimwear at the bottom over to the side - and he took hits oh my god
he took his private part out or whatever got the rubbing in places and stuff, and he tried to what's his stuff in moody, too sad tries to force itself in and thankfully thank god
i was a virgin at the time he fought and pride and pride
he tried his best like he was so good since they tried to jesus
my heart is like racing right now to try to enter into me to faith, and it just wasn't working
it wasn't fitting, thank god, and he did that for probably 15 minutes and after then i guess he kind of gave up and mind you
there was nothing i could do because i couldn't swim
i so i just had to sit there and go through it like, and then i was i was yelling, but i was more so focused on trying to get him trying to convince him to talk to him and try to convince him to take me back to shore or you know at least where the water is an unsafe position, so in-between me yelling and calling for my sister's
i was trying to convince this man to take me back, so he tried for a whole 15 minutes and god must have been with me because it didn't go in
he tried and tried and tried in the track, and he just wouldn't go in st
god, but even though nothing went in nothing just that touching me and rubbing and kissed it and completing his finger places like i, i still consider it sexual assault like to the fullest, so thank god he gave up after, like 15 hold minute when t minutes like literally and he started, welcome back a short me now
one thing i am glad about: instead, he didn't you just drop me cuz, i wan na definitely drown
no one could hear me, no one was right there
i would have died more than likely so lovely
he did walk me back to shore
in a moment, i got like two here with the water punch the man i kicked away from like i kicked him and kicked off against him and i ran
i don't want to say well, because i couldn't really run in water if that makes any sense, but i got away from that man as fast as i could like it's fast as i could
i also thank god that he didn't try to get aggressive back with me, because if he wanted to chase me or catch up with me, definitely couldn't have because he had longer less because he was taller but he'd be end up like actually passing me up, like
thank god he wasn't coming after me, so he called up he kind of went as i'm moving fast
you know walking through the water, it's hard trading or walking through water, and it just felt like i was going through slow motion like it just felt like forever
so he kind of passed me up and he'd beat me to shore, because his last was much longer
he knew how to swim and he was much taller and all of that, so him in his guys
they just kind enough fast, like they were already where the blocker rooms was by the time i got out of the water like
i couldn't see them no more, they were gone, they didn't wash up in the outside shower or nothing, i'm not sure if they went into the locker rooms, because at the interesting you can't really tell so i don't really know
i just know they went around where the locker room was that so i don't know if they love me or if they went in the locker / bathroom or not
but you guys, i'm not even sure
if i told my sisters, i have to ask them, because i'm not even sure if i even told them i was just so hysterical, i didn't even called the police
