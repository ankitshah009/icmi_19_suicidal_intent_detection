hello youtube
i just wanted to say first of all that this is not and never will be, a click beat video
i was thinking about making this video earlier, but it just happened
i ended up taking a nap to get my mind off things and now that i'm awake really trying not to cry
i don't even know how i am crying because i feel like i have like no tears left, but i woke up from my nap and i expected to feel better
i expected to feel better, but i'm not i feel worse than before
i went to sleep
i feel like complete trash, and i don't know if this is gon na - be a good thing that i'm putting this video out on the internet
i don't know if it's gon na be a bad thing, but i feel horrible
i know about none to little people or even gon na see this video
i feel like it's hard to talk to people in person
one-on-one face-to-face but saying it on video is so much easier
i don't know how, just as i guess before you ask in the comments and my old medications am i getting help? yes and yes, i take an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer i take both in the morning and i take foods that night
i do have an appointment to get a new counselor because i haven't been counseled in the past
i want to say three months, but yes, i do have an appointment for that
i don't know
i just feel like absolute trash
it's like sometimes, i feel, physical pain from being alive and the days that i majorly depressed
i also feel pain from even moving, and i can tell you this right now it does suck to suck
i feel like are nothing to know what i've been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, depression, anxiety and bipolar, so the moments that i am happy, it doesn't last long at all, but the moments that i'm sad and feel like killing myself
it seems like good, they last forever, not happy with my life, i'm not doing anything with it
so, what's the point of being here, you know i graduated so none in school, i'm currently taking a gap year until i go to college and they i feel like it's taking forever
i just i feel like it's taking forever for college to get here for having my own car to get here for just pure undeniable happiness to get here
i just feel like it's taking forever
you know people say it does get better
well, when please tell me one because it has almost been 10 years for me for me, it has almost been an entire decade for happiness to come, for this pain to move away - and i know this video isn't gon na get like any views
i mean that doesn't matter to me, it's just that they want friends to talk to
i want people to hear me out
there's a lot that whoever's listening out there healing this video there's a lot
pat, you don't know this video says little to nothing about me about what i've been through right now
i can truly tell you that being alive sucks, it really does right now, as you can see, i'm laying my bet just feels like i have nothing to live for, so why not just go you know i can feel the tears like coming up, but they're, not you know like coming out because, like i said i just feel like i don't have any more left, there might be a little wetness like i just rubbed away, but i was anything that i literally have no tears left to cry
let's slide them all out
you know it's whatever i guess on the inside i kind of crumble at the thought of being happy
you know being around people being alive because it's like i've only experienced that for maybe a few hours at most, but the thought is it happening everyday
it's just like yeah right
never in my life will that happen
of course, some moments in the day i'll be like really happy and like fine with everything content with everything in my life and then a few moments later, you could all just come crashing down
honestly
i feel like i'm not worth it i'll feel like who cares if i die i'll feel like just take me now and it's hard dealing with these thoughts
it really is because it's like who cares, you know like really anyone lis cares about me about my safety about my life
sorry, the camera is moving right
now i literally i'm shaking so bad
sometimes i think, would my family be happier if i was gone, would people even care it sucks that you can't? you know see that part of your life it sucks
you can't see what goes on after you die
you know, but i feel like all this would stop
if i just i feel like all, this would stop
if i just went oh eight, i feel like all this would stop
if i just went away, was it here anymore? what's not alive wasn't just sitting around doing nothing with my life
you know i barely go to work, they barely scheduled me
i don't really do any activities
i mean i do do cheerleading, but that's only two of the seven days
so i'm really just sitting on my ass doing nothing thinking about this type of shit
you know i'm just not happy
