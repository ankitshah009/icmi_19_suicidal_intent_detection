then i have been this past week and, unfortunately, guys that's just part of the challenge
there's going to be many parts of it, that's will be easy and sick and you'll feel successful and you'll feel good about things
but honestly guys, there's gon na be a lot of times when you feel down and you feel depressed and you feel anxious, and you doubt yourself and you you doubt even while you're doing the challenge
i've talked about this a lot if you've been watching my videos, but one thing i kind of wanted to touch on guys is: you know if you've had issues with depression, whether on or off nofap and sadness, and loneliness, even anxiety
you know it's it's, okay, to feel that way
it's okay to feel depressed, it's okay, to feel anxious and uncomfortable you're, entitled to your feelings and you're entitled to your emotions, we're all human beings - and you know it's it's unfortunate guys that we live in a society where it's taught that if you feel depressed, if you feel anxious or shy or uncomfortable in your own skin, that there's something wrong with you and it's from a young age, and you know we learn it in certain social situations, and you know with antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications and and all sorts of formulas and pills and things like that that are offered to us and thrown in our faces to try and help us run from our depression and our and our anxieties and our fears as humans
you know it's it's to a certain degree, our human nature, to want to run from those emotions, because we don't want to experience them, they're, not fun, but the point i want to make to you guys is it's normal to feel depressed, it's normal to feel sad
it's an emotion, no emotion lasts forever, including happiness, including depression, anger, hate, fear, sadness
every emotion is temporary and will pass and guys it's part of being human part of being on this planet is you're gon na go through life and you're gon na experience
thousands of different emotions all the time from day to day - and you know one thing that you're gon na experience on nofap, which is definitely what i've been experiencing this past week, is that, whereas before you know when i had depression and loneliness and and anxiety - and i had negative emotions, i would use porn and masturbation, and even marijuana and and alcohol before, to burry my emotions and escape from the depression and to run away from those feelings, because in the back of our minds, we think that i shouldn't be feeling this way
why am i feeling sad? you know you look around, you see so many other happy people in your life, people that are happened to be having a great day and you're having a bad day, and you just feel if you feel so different from them and and you start to wonder you know why do i feel this way? is there something wrong with me and, and that can definitely lead you back to your behaviors and your addictions so guys? all i want to say is it's
this is how life is it's normal to feel depressed, it's normal to feel anxious and it's normal to feel unhappy and realize that these emotions and these hard times are temporary and if you deal with them in a healthy way and you get through them
you're gon na become a strong-ass person, so don't beat yourself up if you're feeling sad during the challenge, if you're feeling depressed, if you're feeling guilty, let that go it's normal and don't be so hard on yourself through the process, guys it's a recovery and it's not gon na happen overnight, and you need to be patient with yourself
so that's my point today, guys if you're, going through hard times if you're feeling down, i know january, is a cold dark difficult month for a lot of us coming out of the winter
so stay strong and if you're feeling down, if you're feeling like you're going through some rough times just know, this is part of life and no emotion lasts forever
and things will get better for you guys and take it from me because i'm going through some difficult times right now and anyways, i hope that's helped you
i hope you guys are having a good week and sticking to your goals
i'm gon na hit the sack and we'll talk tomorrow, guys hang in there
peace
