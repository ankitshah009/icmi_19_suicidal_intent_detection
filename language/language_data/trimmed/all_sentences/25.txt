you know what i mean like i, don't i'm not a positive person
i don't like people, i don't like the world, you know
sometimes i really wish i just died
you know i never really honestly felt like i'm gon na
i don't feel like
i don't want to make it to 40 anyway, not with my life, not the way i stressed and unhappy as i being sometimes dealing with people shit man
i cannot see any way possible
did i get the 40? i don't know if i'd be here number 10 years
i really don't think jayla 47 would be on this earth in ten years
ten years from now i just my personal opinion
i don't, i don't feel like it
i don't see it, i don't imagine it and, to be honest, i don't want
i really don't care
if i died a day, it would honestly it'd be the best thing that could've ever because i'm just i'm just fed up with people
i don't like people, you know they, they just liars, they're, just the seat, the seat fool they they not
i think this honest, you know i just and for me it just thing like i just had like a bad luck
charm, you know what i mean
it's like i try to do good in this world, and all i ever get back in return is bad back back back
you know it was like
can you get a job jay? that's gon na work for you a job where you want to make the money that you want to make a job where you want to be comfortable at that
you were like where you have good coworkers
no can't get that all you're gon na be able to be able to go back and finish college, my situation and my living arrangements, and things like that
stops me from doing that, and you know what i mean me money to go to college
you know i mean every time i try to get some type of help, as always the type of burden on the court
so that's not the book right now and i need money
i don't got time for college
you know i mean it'd be hard for me to do that
anyway, you know and then it's like what about your depression
you know what i mean, i'm still going through, that i don't know they might know, but i'm mentally though i have major depression, i mean so you're not trying to take medicine for that, but that just seemed like that
just gets worse
my depression is not improving at all like ever since my father died and my grandmom died just like it's just been getting worse and worse and worse, you feel me
so that's not improving
you know relationships
you try to
you know get in relationships for people, but people buddy, don't want that
you know they don't know how to be honest
you know, i mean you give you all and they only they only give you 25 %, but you give a hundred percent
you know it's
just all around the board - man, i'm just this unhappy, but a lot of things that go on man, i'm just fully
i don't like this world, i don't like this world, i don't like people, you know i mean it seemed like life is just so fucked up and unfair
it's like good people
like me, we got ta suffer, you know, we don't have happiness, we don't have mom and i'm not saying i'm not happy like i'm the worst person in the world like as bad as i can be, but i'm just not i'm mad because i'm not where i thought i would be at 27, i thought i would be much further know what i am
i'm not you know and you look around
you see all these evil motherfuckers and people who are not good people
they just moving up in life and you just add a stance, though you know what i mean, and they just first raise me man
you know i had thought about suicide like two weeks ago
i think, like my friendship, he was keeping a room when i was
i had a real bad day and i was just like: what's the point man like, what's the point of living his life like i, i was like fuck, this shit man
i might just kill myself, you know i mean i was really thinking about some
that's the first time in a while
i actually thought like that
i just really was just like
like was my purpose here
you know saying like i can't work at the type of job that i would like to work at, and you know i can't find the type of relationship that i want
you know for the person that i want to be in a relationship with you know
i'm not where i want to be financially, you know, i'm not in the city i want to be in
you know everything nothing's going my way, just nothing
you know saying so and then my family issues, i'm not really on great terms with my family
so my thing is just like: what's the fucking point, you know i mean my nigga like like
what's the point in and living you know, i mean, like you just bet all day
if i'm saying like that's the way, i feel sometimes that's way
i feel if you ain't gon na, be happy than wanted and i mean like who didn't wait for happiness, but i got time for that
nobody trying to wait for happiness
nobody got time to you know i mean it's been a long time
you know i mean, since i've been really really happy, you know, since fucking 2000-2001 am i gon na tell them to wait
no, no 13! more years
you know i mean, but i might be happy i'll
be 40 years old doesn't want to wait waiting to be 40 to need to be happy
you found sad now i don't even see myself getting 40
you know not the way i be stressed out
