hey guys, it's me out a bad day
just got back from a psychiatrist
they were wanting to commit me cove, it's not to put in the hospital this medicine, that's killing off these
whatever from the lyme disease thing, i've got me, i don't know
side effects are bad, got me depressed and the parents want me to pack up and move to their house and sell my house and kept no insurance
now no job, no partner, cuz, they don't even um yeah um
i don't know where i'm gon na end up
just i don't know how much more i could take
we've got everybody parents worried and i had to promise my psychiatrist
i wouldn't kill myself and just feel like crap, but i don't know when it's gon na end him
i just lost everything
i've ever had my life, it seems, but i'm sorry, but how can i be happy, so i don't know that's where i'm at so i don't know
maybe this is a good buy, but this just sucks and i can't take anymore
i just i can't take much
