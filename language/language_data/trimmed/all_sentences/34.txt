hi, this is completely unplanned, i'm tired of my life, so i wouldn't say just recently, maybe like distant past, i don't know my life has gone down the drink
i feel like i've spun out of control and i can't do anything about it
you know i'm going
i don't know where i'm going with this, i feel like
i just need to talk, and then a lot of words will come out
first, we're not gon na address how childish my room is
i am a kid at heart, so, whatever second, i really want to die and here and let me tell you why it all started senior year of high school
i don't know why i've been so depressed
okay, i think
maybe it's just the transition into adulthood or, like i don't know my entire life
i've been controlled up and down by my parents
i've never been able to make decisions for myself
so you know sad to say and kind of i don't even know like boo, but like codependent, like you know, i was very dependent on my parents and i cared what they thought
i cared what they would think about what i would be doing and especially when it came to becoming an adult and going to college, and they had all these high expectations
for me at first i had everything together like i was like i'm going to college
i got accepted into penn
state like this is great whatever, but when i needed help, nobody, nobody helped me okay and not saying like
i wanted it right here right now
i wanted out but like when i needed to help and i was open to actually starting out everything
nobody went to hell me and i just like i got here
i got here i'm here, you guys are being proud of me to my face telling me that everything's gon na be fine but you're not doing anything
to help me
i ended up not being able to go not being able to go because you know anyway
sorry, you know not being able to go because money problems
no look
i just felt like nobody would help me
okay, but the thing is i put myself there
you want to know why, because this dumbass never asked anybody else other than my unreliable parents for help
okay, i don't know if you guys can hear that, but annoying a lot of people that i knew try to reach out
i wouldn't say a lot of people
my best friend's family was very is still is actually very kind to me and they've offered to help me on multiple occasions
why, like? where are they coming from like that? okay, i think it's gone, that they were very kind and they were all you know
you know if you ever need help come to me
we know how to help you dog cuz
my best friend artie, is in college and she's
you know figuring out her life and i'm just here not asking for help and that's the thing like a lot of people have so much pride like right now i came to the conclusion like
why am i like not asking these people who have offered me help for help? the reason why i was so stagnant and not asking for help? it was because i found myself so deep in, like i wouldn't say negative emotion like you know the whole time i've been motivating myself like telling myself
i can do this i can get through this, like you know, trying to be an to mist, which is something i'm not very good at, but i've been trying and it's helped a lot
you know to boost my confidence and to motivate me to actually put my foot forward and get this on the boat
you know what i'm saying: where was i at? what was they even talking about? oh, i was in like such a deep dark place and i laid myself constantly um like well
