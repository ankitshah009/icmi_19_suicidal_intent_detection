you know that was my sister was my mom's first child, so she didn't really know why my sister was acting like this
she kind of just thought it was her acting out and just being a rebellious kid you know, but my sister would take things a little far, for example, running away or just doing pretty much, every bad thing that a parent is caution towards their child or, like tries to prevent their child to do my sister did so pretty much
she would go out with friends and lie about where she was going or she would have the friends pretend to be say, their parents or something and lie about it
something like that
just pretty much all those horrible things there's no way many times and basically like i just needed to give y'all a little backstory of like my childhood and then growing up
also, we didn't live in like a big fancy house or anything
we lived in like a two-bedroom apartment that was a very small apartment in new york
my sister, i don't think i don't think, did much when i was a kid in new york, but when we moved to where we live now, which is georgia, my sister had been older and she started exhibiting signs, and you know there was just basically a lot of fights that i experienced and they were pretty bad fights, that was just what i grew up with
i cried a lot growing up
i was very scared, a lot i'm trying to not cry either because i don't think it's really gon na do anything
if i cry, but i'm sorry, i cry moving on from that all my life
i i've also been very, very very protected and i don't believe i've been protected and the most healthiest ways
i think i've honestly been protected in the most worst ways possible
like i said, my sister used the light of my mom a lot and pretty much not be a good child at all, and my mom took that out on me
she tried to prevent me from doing everything my sister did like she basically took everything that my sister did and then all the consequences that she might have given my sister or try to maybe give my sister she threw it on me also, and basically i was on to go out kind of mentioned this in some videos in a video before, i think it was my mom, but i didn't really go into as serious
it actually affected me because this is something that actually does affect me daily even now, and i'm 20 years old, i'm 22
i can't do anything, nothing on mom
basically, never let me go out
i couldn't go to the movies
i couldn't go to the mall
i couldn't hang out with friends, i couldn't go to anybody's house, nobody would could come to ours and my mom never wanted to drive me anywhere
she would always say she was too tired after work um, which is understandable, yeah she was a single parent
she just had to take care of me and my sister, so she was tired and you know my mom does have her reasons for things i believe
ultimately she does
my mom doesn't mean any harm, but i don't think she realizes a no most parents realize when they're doing wrong for by their kids, and i don't think my mom realized that for me, because she treated me as if i was a second version of my sister and i'm nothing like my sister
i don't think that's how you should treat kids
i don't think that's how someone should treat their kid and trust me
i mean i've gone i've spoken to the few friends i've had about this
i've spoken to a therapist about this therapist wasn't even really an actual therapist
i mean i guess he was, but it was a counselor that they gave us through the school
that's a whole other story, but i've tried talking to other people about this
they've even tried talking to my own mother and i'm saying all of this before anybody tries to come at me and say: oh well, maybe you shouldn't post this
maybe you should talk to somebody like i've tried and i feel like honestly, i'm at a point where i don't know who else to talk to, and so i was never really allowed to socialize
i wasn't allowed to pretty much do a lot of teenagers did growing up and, of course, i couldn't have a boyfriend either so on lately with learning things about people and experiencing like fake friends and experiencing how guys treat women and i'm i'm just late with all of that and it sucks, because i'm not a point where mentally, i feel like i'm mature and should be in a relationship with a man that actually treats me right, but i've just been dealing with so many boys
