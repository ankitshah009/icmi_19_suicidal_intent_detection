oh boy, it's sunday
yes, it's sunday and i'm very tired right now
it's 10 o'clock 10:05! actually in the p
m
and you know i had a relatively good day, but at the same time i'm in another one of my downloads, i feel hopeless
again
i don't know why i just really feel like i'm not doing it and it may just be the tiredness talking, but i feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel and i feel like the more i try, the less success i feel like
i'm getting ever since my mom's come home with my dad she's been in control of what i eat, and i thought that would be a good thing, but sadly now i don't know what i'm eating and i'm not comfortable, not knowing i'm not comfortable
i, like my calorie counting system that i had because i knew what i was getting and i knew what i was doing and now i'm not in control of it and i'm getting ticked off
so my mom makes the foods that she knows i like, but the problem with the foods she knows
i like is that they're not exactly the foods i need to eat and they're, not exactly the healthiest
you have this casserole, it's a little beautiful my favorite castle
it's my favorite food
it's a comfort, food and thing about comfort
foods is they're very high in calories
what it is is it's two cans of cheddar soup, two cans of cream of chicken soup like crave cheddar cream of chicken
six chicken breasts cut up two cans of rice, and this is a double batch
of course, two cans of rice
do you put potato chips on top as like a crust, and you cover that in cheese
i love it
i do it tastes, it's amazing, but i overeat it and i can't even control myself when it comes to that
i have no control over anything right now
i can't control what i'm eating
i can't control myself from how much i eat
i can't control my weight
i was doing so well and now i feel hopeless and um
i've been looking through my videos and i think my highest views is eight
eight views is my highest and that's okay, i'm okay with that, but i feel like i'm not really talking to anybody and i'm feeling like no one's there for me and it's hard for me to stay motivated, trying to keep myself more of it by doing this, but i don't know if i can do it
if no one else supports me um, i'm just scared
i want to go to university and i want to have this great student life where i am suave and i get work done and you know be successful, but the way i look
no one takes me seriously and i don't know what to do, and this is one of my few i'm depressed episodes
i don't have depression
i don't suffer from anything, i'm just depressed right now and i don't know if there's anything i can do no
i need to talk to my mom
i need to tell her straight to her face mom
i love that you're cooking and i love that you're enjoying that you're cooking again
but can you please cook food for me with me in mind because you'll find ways to justify it like today she said: oh, but there's lots of protein in there
that's fine, but if you could give me the protein in a way that doesn't help me gain weight, i broke my rule and i checked in on my weight today and i'm back up at 328
i've gained three pounds: um, that's not right and i'm getting very frustrated at that um because i lost 20 pounds in two weeks
if you remember that, and now we're just over a month in i'm starting to gain again and i'm royally pissed and today is the day after i post this video, so i guess tomorrow will be the day that i post on facebook, that i'm doing this and i'm going to get probably one more viewer, but at least the people who see it will know what i'm doing they'll see what i'm doing and maybe lend a hand
i've been asking on my videos
if someone would make a comment to
let me know that you're out there apparently not and i'm sorry i don't mean to be this guy, but in a way i need to um, but i'm going to go to sleep and i'm going to think happy thoughts
when i wake up tomorrow, i'm gon na start over again and i'm going to regt myself again
so i can keep myself sane and i can keep myself living
losing weight looks right now, i'm not in a good place anyways
i need to heartily thank you for watching today
some of these more depressing videos are no harder to look through, but these are the realities of what i'm feeling and no it's not glamorous, and i'm not always the happy guy that people see at school
this is my other side
this is the side that comes out when i feel like my back's to a wall
so with that in mind, have a good night slaughter and i hope to see you tomorrow,
