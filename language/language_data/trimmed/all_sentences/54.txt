hello, everyone and welcome to the mama weddell family
for those of you that don't know my name is jennifer and i am going to welcome you with the hello hi
this video is going to be a little bit different
i experienced something that i had never experienced before
i was able to capture it on camera um
i actually called my doctor and um
she said: there's nothing wrong with you, you're, not having an adverse reaction to any kind of medication, you're having an anxiety attack
there were some things that were very stressful that that happened
so i can totally see that i will say in the footage that you're about to see i'm not choking, i could still breathe
basically, what happened is like my whole neck muscles, just in my neck and in my shoulders just tightened up, i mean like this
i mean it was like a charley horse, but in my throat and in my shoulders is very very painful
it happened several times that day and i tried to vlog
i wanted to do a vlog on what i would tell my 13 year old self
i would try and i got into it a little bit and then it started and i couldn't get it to stop and it really really scared me
i was pretty upset that day and um
it took me a few days before i could watch the footage and when i did, i realized how awful it sounded and how scary it was going through that person
i wasn't going to share it with you guys at all i mean it's a horrible video
i mean there's no way i would have ever edited it edited
who else has problems that word edited it and and put it out there as content, but i got to thinking and this experience that you and i had
i want it to be an honest one
it's more of a serious kind of honest vlog, but i have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders and take medication to help
this has never happened or experience that i want us to have is i want to
i want it to be real
i want to connect with you guys, so i'm going to show you this clip and just kind of give you the inside of what this particular anxiety attack looks like anxiety comes in all different kinds of forms
you know it can happen in any way and i'm sure there are a lot of you that have experienced different types of anxiety, attacks and disorders

i know that i'm not the only person that goes through things like this, and i don't ever want to be that person that just sits and thinks woe is me like
