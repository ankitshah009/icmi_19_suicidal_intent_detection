i've just been in such a a weird um frame of mind lately and not that i haven't been myself, but i've just had i'm a very emotional person
if you don't, if you don't believe in astrology, then you're gon na roll your eyes at this, but i am a cancer
we are very emotional always, and so you know i'm always emotional, which is recently i've just been
you know a bucket of emotions
i lost someone recently and it was a very weird loss for me
something i'm not necessarily you know hundred percent comfortable
you know going into details, but it was just a very weird relation to that person and the loss just not only hurt because i lost someone, but it just brought back a lot of a lot of feelings
um
a lot of really scary feelings that i haven't dealt with in a really long time
you know they come from a place where i was not happy, i'm not depressed
now i used to be very bad, but i'm not there at all
now i'm very happy with myself and i'm very happy with my life, but just to be back to like those thoughts and that frame of mind to be reminded of all that was just a very it's very emotionally draining um, i'm so i've been dealing with that and i've just graduated high school and um
obviously that's stressful
i've decided i'm going to college a semester late, i'm not taking a gap year, but i need to go uh semester late because i went to school
i live
if you are in maryland, then you know what this means, if you don't live in maryland or you're, not in the dmv area
you're gon na have no idea what i'm talking about you know, but i live in pg county and my score was going to was in anne arundel county because i got started there and it was just really important for me to finish high school where i started
it so i could graduate in the class of people that i know just because i'm a scaredy cat, i really didn't, want to go to a completely new school and meet new people, and my boyfriend is my best friend
i didn't want to not be finishing high school in the class with him
i was just afraid to be away from him and my best friend anaya, and it was just terrifying for me, so i just um
just i didn't do my makeup
cuz now i'm just talking i'm not even doing makeup
it's a 40 minute drive 40 45 minutes um, so i had to wake up super early and every morning bless her soul, she's
so supportive of me, i really do love my older sister um
she drove me to school every day, 45 minutes out from where we moved, and i you know
i always appreciate that for that and because of that i never i did that my 11th right year and my senior year, and so because of that i never really got to do driving school
i never they got through druggie school
so i now have two and i am moving out - i'm jumping i'm jumping around
i never got to do driving school and that wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that i'm moving out
so my mom, my older sister and my stepdad all drive, and they are very helpful with getting me to where i want to be and where i need to be so that i'm grateful for, but they're not gon na
be there to do that for me anymore, because i am moving out um, so i'm starting school, a semester late, because i have to do do driving school and i just want to get that all the way out
the way not only driving school but because i'm moving, i just need to save more, you can never save
you can never save enough
i just need to work, work, work, work and trying to get a job
literally, since i had a job
that's how it worked was march these march of this year, and it is june now it's the end of june now and honestly at first
i wasn't trying very hard like i was like you know, i'll fight here and there, but i've been trying to adamantly get a job honestly since about the end of may and it's now end of june, and the issue with that was because i was not 18 places weren't going to put me on full-time and, if you needed to be, you know 18 to do a full-time or all the rid all the good jobs
