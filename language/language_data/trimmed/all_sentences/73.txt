hi everyone um, i just i don't even know what to say my phone's going off
yes, i'm so done with life, and everything like everybody in my life has hurt me and honestly right now, i'm just like i used to wish for an afterlife to see my mom again, but i don't even want that anymore
i just want everything to stop
i'm done with the pain that i feel like life isn't worth living when all i feel is pain
i just i'm so done with everything i mean it's, not even the fact of what actually happened
it's just it's
it happens all the time with everyone and i'm tired of being played with and i'm tired of feeling like shit like i'm nobody important like like honestly, i can die right now and the only people that actually care would get over it like it tears all over
my face, i just i don't think life is worth living anymore
i mean, i guess i should try to get some sleep clear my mind, but when i sleep i just don't ever want to wake up
i don't want to go through this ever again
i just wanted all the end: hey, i don't want this life me people and i know nobody really cares on here
so i'm not really really worried about you guys
i mean we're not there
i reckon i'm not going suicide, but i guess i'd be a hypocrite
if i said that, since i mean i've tried, i'm thinking about it now, i just i don't know what to do in life anymore
i guess i guess
that's all i really matter seriously
i doubt i'm gon na pass at anything anyway, because my whole life is just screwed up
i know what i wanted out of it
i wanted to build homes for almost people
i wanted to give foster kids home
i wanted to make a good school, so they could learn things that actually matter
i wanted to build
my own dream house have my own children and love them
you know when i guess everything just to our dashboard
it's like nothing's worth anything anymore
