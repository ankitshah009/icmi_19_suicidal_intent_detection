they asked me if i wanted some
i said no because i didn't smoke weed like that
like i've tried it before, but like in this time of high school, i wasn't i've never been a person to just like smoke weed, so i was just like no i'm good blah blah anyways
we after we picked up the weed
we ended up dropping off
all of his friends off at their houses and then me and this boy went to a yogurt place to get some frozen yogurt, so we're sitting there eating our first neighbor
we actually ate it in his car, and i remember we were talking and something about me
like a very characteristic that i kind of wish i didn't have, is that i'm a very flirty person, i'm not purposely a flirt, but i just am actually like overly nice to people, and usually it gets me in trouble with guys that they think i'm flirting with them and i'm not really meaning to but, like i said before, when i started the story, this guy was just a friend to me
i never really saw him in that kind of romantic way
anyways i could tell he was flirting with me and i knew like i was flirting with him but, like i said he was a friend, so i didn't really cared like if it came off as flirting
i don't know, i'm just i'm just a flirty type
i don't really i just i don't know i never really liked
i always flirt with people, but nothing really ever happens with it
you know you just flirt and it's just like
oh, that girl flirted with him before you're gon na, be it's not a big deal
anyways we're just chilling in his car and he was like okay, you only take you home and i was like yeah like okay, let's go home, so i have to read the frozen yogurt
we went to my house and at my house there's a park across the street from my house, but, like you, can still see my house from the park anyways instead of driving to my house
he was like
oh let's drive up here
real quick, like i just want to see what's over here, so he drives to this park
you have to kind of like go up a hill to get to the park he drives to the park and we just chill in his car we're just talking
there's another car at the park already and they were just chilling
do you mind it's around 6 o'clock now kind of getting late outside kind of getting dark, we're just chilling in his car and we're talking and then things kind of got carried away um
he kissed me and guys like it
this boy is not ugly
this guy was actually really cute
he was a friend, you know, i just never thought of him that way, but i was just like you know what hey, why not i? what like you know, i wasn't it wasn't a bad thing that kissed me, so we start making out and that's as far as i thought things would go like us making out
you know i never really hung out with him outside of school
besides talking to him
after school, but i never really hung out with him so we're just we just start making out and i'm thinking us as far as it's going to go, considering we've never had like a real conversation like i don't even text this guy after school
you know i mean so we're making out for about 10 minutes when this guy says do you want to make out in the backseat, because, like the way we were making out his like, he had like a a console, a center console, and it was really huge
so we're like leaning over it, so it's kind of really uncomfortable, so he was like
do you want to go to the backseat and like make out - and i was like sure like why not you know what like we're already making out? why not he's a good kisser? i don't mind it: let's, let's do it, so we hop into the backseat and we start making out once again and then we stop because he asked me like if i want to give him a massage, and i was like boy no, i'm not about to give you a massage, like you, give me a massage, i probably at this point sure just went home and not giving any massages or taking any massages, but he starts to give me massage she's massaging my back and it doesn't really get anything crazy
just massaging me and i'm laying down on his seat and he's like straddled on top of me
so this is me laying down and then he's like sitting like that on top of me and he's massaging my back after of like 10 minutes, he stops and he was like okay, you're gon na give me a massage, and i was like you know what
why not i suck at massages like it, took him along just to convince me to give him a massage, because i literally stuck at massages, but i was like you know what why not
so i start giving him a massage
so after about five minutes of me, massaging him um, he decides to flip over so like right now he's on his back and i'm on top of him charlotte, like this five minutes later, he like flips himself this way so now i am like straddled
on top of this boy's penis area and like yeah, he leans up and he starts kissing me and we're making out and i'm basically like straddling this guy
basically, but, like i didn't mean to put myself in this position, it just that's
he flipped that way, and now that's what was happening when we were making out once again, i didn't think i was going to go any further than us making out like
i said i never really talked to this guy like that, and i really flirted with him like that
it was always just friendly conversation, so we started making out and eventually i'm kind of getting tired of it
like you know, it's like when you make out with someone too long, it's like okay, either something's gon na happen next or it's gon na stop there
so in my head, i'm like it's gon na stop, so i pulled him out
i pull back and i'm just like
okay, like i think, i'm gon na go home now it was like no like just stay just stay and i was like no, i probably should go home
i got a feeling that you might be
do i tell you? oh, you can tell me if or wrong girl
i think you might be
