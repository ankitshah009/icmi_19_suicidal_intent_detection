everyone was telling us it's gon na, be fine
it's not that bad and then it randomly just went to stage 4 and then he randomly um just passed away
one night and i woke up to firemen and people inside my house, carrying my dad out and my sister just crying on me and my brother
just trying to hold me down i've never even accepted it
i don't know, i don't know if the hardest part for me is that i don't feel like
i can remember my dad
i know really um
i just feel like i'm just i don't know
i just haven't alright um, so after he passed away, i was already having a lot of issues in school and stuff because i'm dyslexic - and i never wanted to do anything - that's school hot for me like to offer
i've always wanted to either do entertainment or music, and i would get bullied a lot because i used to dress really weird
i used to wear hats and skinny jeans and all and look how i look like pretty much today
so i get bullied a lot
so i would, after my dad passed away, i would go to therapy and stuff for about four, maybe three years
i don't i think three years and i would have to go pretty much once every three days or something like that and it was pretty miserable because they would always have to like check my weight and stuff because they thought i was too skinny and then i'd feel bad about myself and i feel like i'm, not gaining weight, i'm not eating healthy enough, i'm too skinny and there was just a lot of bad things happening that year, those years it was like about four years that was really depressed
i went to, i think three institutions for like a week each and one was really scary one
i had a stay there and it was like actually crazy people and they're like no offense to crazy people, but they're people that, were you, know, little loony and i actually got thrown in there
i got thrown in thought
i was gon na get killed by a guy for no fucking reason, which was really scary, and i think that guy was my roommate
if i can remember, it was really fucking scary - and i remember talk to my mom and being like - i need to get the fuck out of here because they're some guy that wants to kick my ass and then next thing
i know he got kicked out because i told the people so i was safe
i think i'm fine now, but that was really scary
that scared the shit out of me, and i think i was there for you cuz
i was so depressed that i wanted to kill myself and um
i don't know, i think i i remember when i was there, i would um want to uh get out and then just kill myself like right
the day i got out, i was just like i'm gon na kill myself, and there are many like times where i tried to i
i would just i just remember, i'm sitting on my house like the roof of it and just thinking and just wanting to jump off like and just fucking end it, but for some reason i did it because i felt there was a little light at the end of this road like there was just a reason for me to keep on pushing, even though my life was feeling like complete and utter crap, and i didn't think i didn't think anything would get better
i don't feel like i'm gon na get too much into my past right now, um
i don't know why one! i can't really remember it right now, i'm overwhelmed which happens to me a lot
i always forget my past, which is kind of weird but yeah
i just i was just i was really mean
i was just a bad kid back, then i was really misunderstood and i treated my family like crap and i treated a lot of things like crap and i just had a lot of bad things happen and i don't really feel like getting into those right now
yeah, so suicide and all that and cutting it fucking sucks guys it's it's the worst pain
