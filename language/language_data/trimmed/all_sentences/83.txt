hi i haven't recorded a video in a while then using another channel, but i forgot the passcode
i wanted to make this video to show people what suicide does
i know you already know as soon as say kills you obviously that's what, but it does a lot more
it breaks you completely
first, i have to say warning this may trigger some thoughts or actions that you may do to yourself
so if you are extremely triggered or scream extremely offended to suicide, do not watch this video
i haven't made up for this one
i sometimes do but right now not doing this for a lot of reasons to show people that i'm trying i'm trying not to do that stuff anymore, i'm trying to get better, but it's gon na be hard for me
i for people who don't know me
i have extreme suicidal thoughts and actions still have at wrist
i've tried multiple times
obviously every single one has failed
it hurts
it hurts a lot talking about this trying to express to people what this feels like see
a lot of people like the cut for the same thing right now, you're complete fucking idiots
you don't even have a reason, for you have a person in a band
that is not a reason for it
a lot of times
suicide is caused by a lot of things changing around you, my father, i'm not gon na, say or anything suffered from well
he still is suffering from and alcohol an alcoholic and extreme depression
i have depression and anxiety, which all add up
it was one of the reasons why my parents got divorced a couple years ago
it hurt a lot and that's when i sort of spiraled into this phase, a lot of people call it the emo phase
yes, it is email
i am very i'm very email, but i never really noticed any of the stuff going on around me and i sort of just tumbled in to my suicidal thoughts last year when i actually made those videos when i made i just watched the cinnamon challenge video
i didn't even know that i was like i've tried, choking myself, which i've done multiple times now, one notch with myself at joker's, and that's why, on my old page, i actually had to take it down, because i was getting so much hate on it
i made a video video stuff video about the choking yet because it's so stupid, but at the same time i was choking myself almost every day
it was an addiction
i almost did take full doses of painkillers
try to kill myself, someone caught me and yeah that whole thing went down
i've been called multiple things by the person, my father, who doesn't even know that i have suicidal problems
he just thinks i'm brad
he just thinks i'm a golf brat and see a lot of people on the internet saying that they don't have a reason
they all have a reason to kill themselves
i feel fucking reason depression
all around me, people calling me things
i have voices in my head
i know i sound like insane right now telling me go, kill yourself
no one fucking cares
no one loves you
no one cares about you
no one would care about you if you died
people would just kick you around and treat you like peace shit like they already do, wouldn't care at all
my mom found out about my suicidal thoughts
my school counselor told her and one of my best friends told her town that people really do care
a lot of people have changed my life and my actions about myself
so this is the video to kill people if you're thinking about committing suicide or have suicidal thoughts
do it too in july, it takes a hold of you and it some people just do it for pity
that's all they do it for this giveaway bullshit
i don't want to show you me crying anymore, but i just want to make this video just show people what it does educate
people like you shouldn't, kill yourself, and you shouldn't do this to yourself
thank you for putting on this video
