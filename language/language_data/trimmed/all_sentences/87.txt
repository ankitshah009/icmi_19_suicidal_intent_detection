okay, so i'm a mess right now and i was actually going to shower even though it's almost three o'clock, but the water was all cold
so no luck, but this being a mess kind of made me want to talk about something that i've really been wanting to talk about for a while anyway
so well they're a lot of the time i think of myself as ugly, and i don't think that that's a bad thing
a lot of the time is just something that i can accept and be cool with and get on, and i can just be okay with it
just like a lot of overweight people, don't want to be told that they're not fat
i don't want to be told that i'm not ugly
i don't want to call myself unconventionally pretty
i am happy a lot of the time to think of myself as ugly
i think ugliness only becomes a problem when you let it get in the way of your life end of living
i can't say that i've, never let that happen, but it's something that i'm dealing with and i'm generally okay with when my appearance really gets to me and i'm feeling really gross about it
i try to remember a few things
one is that i am beautiful in some way, because i'm a living thing - and i think living things to me at least - have some inherent beauty
there was an interview with johnny depp a long time ago, which i saw on youtube somewhere, and i think he was asked something like what is your greatest turn-on and he said breathing
you might have just been saying that to be funny or whatever, but it's kind of true there's something really sexy and really beautiful about being alive and when you think about being alive - and you put that into perspective - and you just think about the smallest and biggest thing just breathing prettiness seems to become so insignificant and just tiny, tiny
so one way i can saw myself is by reminding myself that i am beautiful, because i am alive because i am breathing, and that is amazing
another way that i can soul myself or deal with it is by putting things again into perspective
i think about the universe and i think about human beings as a species and how actually ridiculous
we look
other mammals and i've got four legs and have some kind of really elegant, gait or i mean even cows, just seem like kind of magical beings, whereas humans are covered in hair, but you can't see most of it
you just see like stuff that comes out of their heads
randomly we've got these facial features that are just like very strange, even when looking at beautiful people, if you look at them long enough, it just starts to look like ridiculous to me
at least we don't have this elegance or majestic beauty as a species that lions have or birds or anything when you put it into this perspective, everything just seems absurd
it's not absurd to recognize that you're not way that a lot of other people look, but it's absurd when you waste too much time on it
when you look at the perspective of being part of this kind of silly looking species on this planet in this solar system, in this universe, that is huge and contains life-forms that we haven't even encountered yet and that are completely foreign to us
think about that and then i come back to my face in the mirror and god i wish i just had cheekbones or some kind of facial definition
it's it's tiny
another thing that goes along with the breathing and the living is that we are living creatures, which means that we're not just alive but we're doing things
even when we're not consciously trying or aware of things we're breathing and when you actually do things other than that
when you get out and you're doing stuff and when you're really engaged and excited in something, i feel like the last thing that i care about is how i look
i never want to get into this place where i feel like what i look like is more important than what i do and it seems like it's a lot easier to
let myself not do anything and to hold back, because i don't feel that i have a certain appearance for some reason that that exempts me from having to do things
but it makes me any less capable, but it doesn't, it might make it harder and - and it might take work on my part but being beautiful, is not an accomplishment and being ugly have to stop you from making accomplishments
i talked about the show my mad fat diary the other day, but i didn't touch on one of the main basic reasons that i really loved it because i just didn't feel i had enough time and it didn't fit in the video
but basically, that show is just this grand statement, the work of art showing that you can be fat or you can be ugly or you can be whatever it is, that you are and you can still live and you can still find happiness and you can still be hopeful and you can make relationships and have friends and have lots of fun and be a good human being and grow and be happy and do the things that you want to do, and that means a lot to me
i don't think that we get that message enough or when we do get it
it's coming from the people who are already seen, it's really pretty so it doesn't just doesn't have the same effect on me
that show has given me a lot of inspiration
there's a quote, but from kristen stewart at which i'm sure tons of other people have said, which is just it's okay, to not be okay, and i think that's one of the great things of the show is that it lets
you know that it's okay to not be okay, but also that it's okay to be okay and that you can just be okay
you don't have to be beautiful to be okay, you don't have to be pretty to be okay, you don't have to be skinny to be okay, you don't have to have muscles to be okay, you don't have to have anything, you can just be you and you can be okay with that and you don't have to be okay with that all the time and you can still struggle with it, but you can still find some kind of acceptance and love and happiness for yourself, and that is huge
ah, the first episode of my mad fat diary is just really fantastic too, because it deals with all these insecurities about her body and you think that the character ray is gon na cave into it and she's gon na relapse, and just let her insecurities about her body take over, but she doesn't and she just has fun and she laughs and she does things and she doesn't let it get in the way of her living, and that is what i think we need to review reminded of more and what i try to remember
whenever i get dragged down by the mirror or when i notice myself watching myself from within whenever i'm out somewhere, i can be things and i can do things and i don't have to let my body or my insecurities about it, get in the way of what i really want, and sometimes i feel beautiful and i think that's an important thing to recognize too that whether anyone else can see me that way that i can and ultimately feeling, beautiful or feeling ugly can feel like the same thing as long as you don't feel
like either one of them has to get in the way of what you can do and of who you can be because they shouldn't and they don't, and that is something that i am trying to remember always
