i've been sad because you know um, and i can't really talk about this shit, which pisses me off um
i guess, but i had gone through when i was younger, has made ha has affected my life as an adult um
i think the way i was explaining today one was some people that have been molested when they were younger
when they grow up, they either do drugs
they turn to prostitution
they get obsessed with having sex um, they love older men um, and i guess the only reason
the only way to explain myself is my anxiety and depression
i was so fucked up in the head and i went through so much shit when i was younger that now it affects my life, my day-to-day life every single day um
i feel like there's not a day that goes by where i'm not sad, there's not a day that goodbye when i'm not crying, there's not a day that goes by when i would represent happy
and yes, i know that you know update lynne
she makes me happy and i think that people that goes to what i go through you know you can't truly explain this
you can't express the way you feel um
i think that i feel like if i was given anything in the world
it wouldn't make me happy, and i feel so terrible that that dave len has to deal with me
it makes me sad
it's affected, you know not affected our relationship, but i feel like every time i talk to her
i'm sad and i have to say the same thing over and over again and she doesn't quite understand, but she understands to an extent and i've noticed i'm sorry that i'm crying i'm sorry that i can't control myself, but this is a vintage ellie
this is me expressing my my feelings, um, i feel like i feel, like i'm, making dadeland sad
i've never seen her so sad lately
she says it's because a body issue her body issues
she says they're getting to her, but i feel like me, i feel like i can't talk
no, i don't know how to say it
i feel like i have made her depressed
i've put her i've
i don't know, i don't know
i honestly have no idea
daelin is such a happy person, you guys know you see it in the videos
she's always been a happy person, and maybe the past week or two things just have been sad it our relationship is not rocky, that's best for sure consist
raagas has ever been i'm just saying that i feel, like my depression
wears is wearing off on her and i feel bad and i feel sad because i would never want someone to feel the way
i feel never
and when i see her cry and when i see her sad, it breaks my heart even more: it breaks my fucking heart
