hey how you doing, but i'm on much lately just been so weak
sorry about that
oh you guys who thought keep it up on post never did
i will have to turn my this i coming out and talking to you all anyways, i'm here to talk to you about suicide
one number one leading deaths in the u
s
, probably even around the world, us we have main problem bowling suicide thousand main couple episodes reasons
breakups social abuse, regular abuse, physical emotional, it happens gives a ton of reasons but happens mainly with teenagers
i believe nothing, not good, because those teenagers haven't lived
they haven't experienced all the life they've experienced
can you fired from the first job or going on and marrying someone falling above some teenagers do get that not many most teenagers aren't married if they did 15 or anything, i'm sure as hell, not but suicide
it takes that stuff away from that person
we all can help that person out
you know we can talk to them, say what's up man, why are you struggling to you why you? why are you crying last hour why you kind of work today we can talk to them
there's many different ways
we can talk to them too
don't go straight up them yuck, and why are you crying don't do that? it's not good
try me not subtle, but it's easing to it
don't straight, go in, say why you crying today talk to that
i mean they're, probably not gon na, want to just go straight in just let them know you're there for them go to them
tell them! i'm here got your back
if you need anything boss laying into you i'll, try and stand up for you, don't risk job but trying the person i now can get to whatever they're having problem with
maybe they were divorced or having problems with financial
you know that maybe they're homeless they're not be able to support themselves with job
maybe you offer you your room up to them with them half of the couch for a little while, so i can get back on their feet and sell the debt there, but also with teenagers
if you're walking on the halls and see someone crying don't just go
okay, they're crying swords normal
it is normal, but it's not normal
just to let it go
don't do that
you can help someone out many different ways being there
it's number one way, always let someone know you're there for them
if you care about them, let them know that don't just blow them off
many people go through many different things
some are raked shot at beat it up
we're just called me names and that takes into them
it doesn't mean that you can just let it be
if you see you know someone, don't do something like that
don't let go you can't let that go
it's not good
there's all different types of suicides
we all know that some hang themselves
some take pills, there's all different kinds
tell it a friend of yours or someone, you know be one of those people on the list of suicide
don't let them be that number on the end of the year, nah suicides 2015
don't do that, try and help them out
don't let them be bullied, fired
they're fired, they may have been fired for a really good reason
so, just let him go home and just be homeless, maybe help them out
so many different things you can do
i want you all to drive for just one minute every day
