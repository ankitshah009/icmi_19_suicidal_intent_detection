i feel particularly sad today, under the weight of the loss of that which i've left behind to be here in india has required a lot of sacrifices
i essentially had to just turn my life upside down and say goodbye, so many so many things are part of my identity
there
one thing that is really hurting my heart
well, it's great news, but it's also heavy on me
it i work for my boyfriend's company
it's called pretty instant and i love being a part of this company
i love being on the team like we do such great work together
it's a it's
a photography company design for its interactive, its design for instant sharing, live from events
so it's a wonderful company
there's an amazing team behind it and they recently, while i've been gone, had some huge wins and i just i'm like heartbroken to not be a part of it yeah
so i'm feeling really sad and you know you can be in paradise, you can
you can get the thing you want, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're gon na be happy when you're there they're still going to be they're still going to be all the all this stuff of life, all the choices and all the choices
it's way comes down to choices
when you choose one thing, you can't have it all and i feeling the pain in mine
that's okay! so i'm here in go karna and i'm going to use internet because i've been sitting in an internet black hole for a while sitting on the students doorstep, but i really needed help
the lack of internet recently just try to upload some photos from the beach has just been impossible and just just feeling really frustrated hello, yeah, alright yeah
so that's how i'm feeling today
