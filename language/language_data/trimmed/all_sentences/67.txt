um tear on this card um
basically i was wanting something
i've been really hurt for a while, and i've tried so many times to give up and it hasn't worked, and i you know if someone wants to kill himself, they would probably do it like they would find a way, and maybe because i failed, it was probably because i didn't want to just yet - or i wasn't ready to stop myself somehow right now, i feel ready
i feel like i'm just a waste of time to everyone and that i fucked up so many times that i just like it's it's getting frustrating to myself and other people
so i've got some 100
i don't really know what to drink with it
probably dinner teacher um, but doesn't matter if we just end up fucking dead after because i don't really want to deal with going back into hospitals anymore
so that's how i want to do
i don't want to spend my life in hospitals or treatment, centers or sad
i don't want to be sad forever, plus i want to be with my dad because he died
so it's kind of unfair to me that i'm just here he is there, i mean we were really close and it's not fair and i don't know - maybe it's not fair that i'm going to do this and everyone's just going to be stuck here
but hey people deal with things differently
i guess i just do it in a bad way
some people just aren't cut out for this whole fight shit, and i honestly i truly loved every single one of you that i met
maybe i was an asshole to some of you, but this i don't know, maybe i see it easier taking it out on you, because you deal with things good
i don't know alex over chefs key
you were my boyfriend for almost eight months, and that was my first real boyfriend or i didn't know how to deal with
i didn't know how, to date, like i honestly didn't know how i'm surprised, honestly, that i losted that long, because you took my shit, you dealt with my shit, you fucking handled it for me, like i, don't know how you did that, like you were so into my problems that i feel felt like i didn't even have any at the time, and maybe that's what i missed
maybe i missed having those problems, because i just hate putting that burden on people and i'm really sorry alex
i was so confused
this is the one thing that i hate that i am so confused
you know i'm not against gays or lesbians, i'm not at all
it's just it's just confusing when it comes to yourself and what you want, because i'm always so indecisive about what i want
you know - maybe i am straight or lesbian, i don't know my mom says: there's really no such thing as sexual, but i guess she just says that because she's straight and she doesn't know really, it is so uncomfortable and i'm sorry i don't mean to hurt any of you by doing this, i really don't i'm just so sad, so i guess this is goodbye seriously
i love you all so much even alex fuck
i know i cheated on you
i lied to you and i said some freaking hurtful things to you
what i still do, love you and you can no right to tell me what i care about what i don't care about, because i too care probably too much and maybe that's why fuck you up and that's why i broke up with you because i didn't want to hurt you anymore and now, maybe if i keep living then i'll just continue to hurt everyone around me
what if i do this i'll hurt you all one more time and that's it
goodbye
