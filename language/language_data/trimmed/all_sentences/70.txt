it is like fucking heroin and you can't get away from it like you know
people are like, oh, but you know you can choose this
you can choose that
that is like having somebody carry around a fifth of vodka that is open or a martini all day
long in their fucking alcoholic and that's their favorite thing in the world, sugar addiction is one of the hardest things in the world to get rid of, and i don't know how people fucking do it
and if, if there was a way that you know, i could figure it out, and i would do it on my own believe me and i feel like a constant failure
i feel like if i have a piece of candy or if i have a handful of gummy bears or if i have you know a piece of cake at a party or something like that
or if i have this event that i'm failing myself and that that takes a toll on me because after i've had those things, those feelings and everything that i'm trying to eat down mentally and emotionally, i'm in a lot fucking pain
and i don't like to come on here and be like yes, i did this and that i'm hurt that it's awful its worst thing ever and when i wake up like i can barely move and when i'm trying to get down the stairs like i sit down and try to scoot down i'm like
i don't want to tell people that, because, even though you guys know that i had issues with my back at my hip there is that part of me where i'm like some people, have it so much worse
so what the fuck am i crying about? what is my deal? what is my issue? you know some people like are in wheelchairs
some people have, ms, some people
have you know lou gehrig's disease
some people have shit, that's not curable, they don't need just a hip replacement, they don't need just to lose weight
these people have honest-to-god horrible diseases, and here i sit like why are you big, fucking fucking baby, and i am trying really hard not to think about the war
it's stills my breath from my lands, i'm trying not to look at the news and try not to talk to people about it
i'm trying not to you know, ask too many fucking questions because i'll lose my shit
have it my husband in danger and there's nothing
i can do about it and there's no way i can get to him at the moment
so when i see him on skype, i don't talk about working
he doesn't talk about that stuff with me because he doesn't want to scare me hard, but people haven't worse
so when i don't deal with shit like this, when i do the one extreme or the other, what i don't actually work hard, whatever is bothering me, i have different kind of hitting attacks where i start shaking and my hands go numb and my lips turn blue and my fingernails turn blue and i can't feel my toes and i'm just shivering as hard as i could possible until my neck and my head is like busted
it really
the only thing that makes it better is for me to go, take a hot shower and then know that i have to deal with this
i have to deal with it i have to
