look how depressed i am
i don't even care about black crowns like in trouble
why a microphone so mighty? i'm not my problem
i don't give a damn what kind of group hello! my name is jody and i am depressed today and that's okay
what else you know i have to be kind to myself these days come my therapist told me that it was healthy to wake up and not check if you're depressed aisa wake up, and i'm like
how am i feeling today am i here
the answer is always no, i'm still spaced out still don't really feel like i'm awake, and then i go
oh, no and now i'm depressed as well after you recommended not checking
i felt better because i was like oh yeah, i'm just going to continue with my day who says if you check, then you usually find so i stopped clock in problem
is today i don't have to joke
sometimes you just wake up and your brain is so heavy
you can't help but notice that so my topic today now is idea and depressed
i know so well when i'm depressed, i can just tell exactly when my brain isn't working properly
it's very chemical
it feels very physical
there are days when i feel sad, and i know it's emotional and it's because of a situation or something that's getting me down
it's like a weight inside my body, whereas when it's like a chemical depression, this feels black
my brain feels rotting
nothing works like i don't get anything your chest is heavy the whole day
i just feel this constant longing for something and i'm not getting it suddenly
nothing is easy
everything seems terrifying and difficult and complex, and messy and heavy like nothing's, going to be okay
ever again, and that this is the normal, this is where my head goes to naturally, and that every time i show how you're feeling better you're going to feel better again bits of life and i'm lying to myself, and this is how i should just naturally feel and i should just stop treading water and let go and give up and just fall down to this dark pit
where i am now wow, i should put disclaimer at the start or something this isn't a very positive video
i guess, but i interesting to catch it in the moment just might like working head
am i not working head are so different and they don't have empathy for each other asshole when i'm feeling healthy, i'm like how on earth could i ever not feel like this? there's so much to be happy about anna sermon to be hopeful for why not just choose happiness and choose the hopeful route
i can't put myself in my happy minds at the moment, but that's i think, what i feel i remember just being like
oh, i always know i'll come up afterwards, there's always enough after a down, and i will feel good again and that's what i write down in all my diaries and on my wall
don't worry, you'll feel
okay again, this is just temporary for us right now
if i was to write a message to my happy self, i don't want to do that
obviously, i'm not going to bring you down happy me if i want to it would be like love
stop killing yourself! i'm not going to do that because i know objectively, i'm sure this is just my brain up
no-one's natural state should be this bad, it's so bad, so bad! oh! this is when you know, you're depressed you just get nothing from anything i'll watch a tv show and i'll be like
i wonder what else there is to do i'll go outside now, just feel hopeless and like well
this is, i want to be outside when it's nice and feel nothing i'll go back in and back
why don't? i just spend a whole day in bed, considering i'm not gon na get anything from anything else
when i was depressed in the summer my mum had booked this trip to like a water slide in, i don't know it's like a groupon, whatever i'm blessed to try
i love her so much
she was like this will cheer you up and i'm like mom when you're depressed you don't really get cheered up by things
so we're a functioning happy version of me
we'll go down a waterslide and go
we depress me
it's just going to feel a bit cold and uncomfortable so just kind of put the body in a slippery wet thing below in terms of where i'm at i'm still dreaming still feel very much like i'm not here
the realizations depersonalization like a car as my eyes widen, are when i look like far away from me
everything just looks like painted on it
just don't feel real and that's what's so frustrating and that's what gets me down
that's what makes me depressed it's like
i know that i'm not getting the full picture of life
i feel blind
i feel like someone's, taken something away from me and it's so annoying that i used to feel so excited for feeling, everything and everything being so vivid and so much fun
and it just feels like someone sucked out the fun of every
i have to experience and i'm so scared that i'll never feel that again and that's why i get so hung up on the past all divided, because i felt it then will i ever feel that again and it feels like i never will so i just want to go back to where i can feel again, i'm sorry, i'm depressed, i'm usually a little bit kinder to myself and i'm like there's no point in just wallowing, and i find the funny treat yourself do something nice
but when i'm this bad, it's like taking a bath is just going to make me feel hot and bored going to bed is just going to make me lie in the dark
i feel bored eating edamame beans
this is actually quite nice
so that's why i did that yeah, i don't know it's just annoying when you're sitting under jock stuff is being my pain yeah, so i felt like drunk for the past four years of my life and they're like alright
let's get you a blood test, i guess so
i have my rose
