hey guys, so i have some news
after my last video, i was planning suicide and, as you guys know, i've been planning suicide for a long time now and on christmas i attempted suicide and i just got out of millard wan, it's kind of like a mental facility to keep you safe on christmas
i was at my friend's house and we were talking and we were drinking and after that we both went to bed and i slept in the basement and i've been making a video for a long time now and it's maybe an hour and a half long
and i couldn't take it anymore and i started writing writing letters as well to a lot of my friends and family
but i never got to the family because their letters would be longer than the letters to my friends and i never got to them
but on christmas day it was nighttime, it was maybe midnight or 1:00 a
m
and i couldn't take it anymore
it's really depressed and i just really really really wanted to go
so i never finished it
so i ended up making a video saying goodbye and i wrote one little letter saying that i'm sorry because my friend would find me dead
in the morning um i took a meat knife and i cut my legs in my arms, my forearms and my stomach
i have some cuts right here and then i put a an alarm clock cord around my neck and i was going to hang myself but, as i said, i was drinking and i think that's what saved my life
i was too drunk to hang myself, but i attempted it and i passed out well, i took the cord offers and i passed out from the bleeding, but i was sort of still awake, and so i stumbled my way up the stairs to my friends room and he was dead asleep because a heavy sleeper and i ended up knocking over a dresser with my feet, my legs
well, i was on the ground bleeding out and that woke him up and he was he was panicky
you don't know what to do and he was just screaming and he couldn't he hesitated
he didn't know whether or not to pick me up in the dark or turn off the lights
it took him a few seconds to actually turn on the lights and then, when he turned on the lights, he saw me there's blood everywhere on my arms and he said he was drinking too and he didn't know what to do
he was a drunk drunk, but he was drinking, so i could tell he was just hesitating to stay sober to get me to the hospital and then we drove there and on the way there
i opened my the car door, the passenger door and i attempted to jump out and he had to pull me back in
i think i was just really pissed off that i didn't worth the first time when i tried committing suicide because i was too drunk
i couldn't hang myself and then we got to the hospital and they had to do a cat scan
they had to check my neck because there was a huge like line going around it and i'll show you the picture right now
that is my neck right there
after the lion clark, clock cord was um, it was wrapped twice around my neck and i went to go, hang myself with it, but it never worked and i will show you the cuts right now and if you don't like seeing cuts, don't look, but here are the cuts - this is what happened that night when i did that, and these are just a few hours after so they were pretty deep somewhere deeper than others, but most of them were just batches because i couldn't find a razor
so i used meat knife and i don't know if it was dulling out, but it was pretty sharp
i think i was just because i was drunk then i can go really deep and on the way to the hospital, the er, my or i called my mom, and i was crying
you know screaming, and i called my brother as well and they all met me at the hospital, but only my mom could come back for some reason, so they just dropped me off and told me that they loved me and then they went home just to wait
what and see what would happen so i was in the er for a few hours because we were waiting for a spot in miller devon, the place i was talking about where they keep people safe, and i was on a 72-hour hold and we had to wait for a spot, so i was in the er for a few hours until i was wheeled over there and i spent five days there because on a weekend, weekends don't count as a 72-hour hold and my friends came and visited for a little bit and we went over what would happen after this, and now i'm in ilp, which is intensive, outpatient therapy and it's maybe three times a week for three hours a day and i have to be in there for maybe three to six weeks
we don't know yet and yeah
that's pretty much what happened and being in that mental health hospital
i was kind of going insane
actually, it's kind of ironic that place was actually making me go psycho, but i learned a lot of things and there are a few people that were dealing with depression as well
but when i compared myself to them - and i know in the other video - i told you not to compare yourself with others, but with this compare myself with other people made me feel like my problem, so so small compared to others, and it made me happy in a way but at the same time, sad because i feel bad for them
so i was glad that i went to the mental health hospital to see different perspectives and now hopefully, after this ilp, i will be going to monthly or weekly sessions of therapy
with this christian-based place, but after i attempted my life, i traumatized a lot of my friends in my family, especially my mom, and doing that makes me feel it would help with my pain in that it doesn't matter what others think it's what you feel there's still even my feelings pass on to other people - and i don't - i haven't - really really realized that until i actually attempted suicide, so i'm kind of glad that i did it in a way, but at the same time i really hurt my family
now i have marks all of my arms in my legs and i'm kind of ashamed being out in public and people are gon na see these and i'm not i'm not ashamed at the same time, because you know this is my story, i mean this is what i went through at the same time
i don't want people thinking that i'm some depressed girls, that is faking her smile every day
besides, that, i don't want to go into details and everything that i learned and i saw in miller, duan the mental health hospital
i want you guys to know that i am very, very grateful that you guys have subscribed to me and if you haven't, i'm still grateful for your mess and i'm sorry that i haven't written back to most of you
i've been busy
of course, i've been in the hospital and i've been in therapy, but i will try so hard to write you guys back so until next time
i hope you guys are doing well and i hope, there's some sort of way that you can cope with your depression or your anxiety, whatever you may have, so i'm gon na end the video now
but i want you guys to know that
i love you and i'm not the only one that loves you just know
there's people out there to help you so don't give up if you've learned anything from this
i hope that you took away that you deserve to live like i said just remember that there's someone out there that loves you and i'll talk to you guys later
