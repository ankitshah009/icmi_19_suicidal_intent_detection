hey guys, it's february, 8th 2016, i'm still in a pretty bad place, i'm starting to wake up and think of suicide
every morning, i think about about jumping off a bridge
are you using pills to kill myself? i can't i can't do this anymore
this is destroying me, i i don't even feel like i'm living
it's just
i feel like my family's given up on me
i feel alone
it feels like the only thing i can do is be on the computer for about 20 minutes
i'm gon na stop searching for explanations
i don't know anyone who's been through this
i don't know anyone who's come back from from four months of this i mean what's left of me, even if i get it together, i can't stop thinking of suicide
i can't stop worrying
i can't stop comparing myself to other people, i'm saying everything that i don't have
i desperately need someone in my life
i can't i can't make that happen, because i i can't even get out of bed
i remember in october when this first happened when i, when i just lost my mind, i was so confused and so scared that i asked my family for help
they said i need help
i don't know what's going on
i don't know how to to make this
stop or how to get better, they told me what what do you want us to do? what do you expect us to do, and they were angry that i had
i had asked something like that
no, i i didn't know what to do, and so i i was some kind of failure
i tried to explain to them
i just need help, i don't know what's going on, i don't know how to get better and it just looked at me and shrug their shoulders said
well, we can't help you and you know how many visits i've gotten from my sister, how many phone calls to ask if i'm okay done any kind of support, an understanding that i can't do this alone, none! i can't get better because i have no support system
i have no one that believes in me
i just get worse and worse and worse, i keep giving me medications and they don't seem to do anything
they just make me tired and just make me out of it, and i just stay in bed all day next to a space heater in a dark room
i don't want to do this anymore
i think a person a person should have a right to say that this is enough
i'd like to say that i'm not i'm not being held by the medication professionals, don't seem to know what to do
my family refuses to even listen to even care, i'm completely alone
every day i go days without talking to people i go days without going outside like about days, praying for death, i think before when i was really really close to doing you know i had a fear of it
i had a fear that i i would mess up or that i was sacrificing something or that i i fear being dead
now i don't fear any of it
i don't care anymore
i don't care what my family has to find
i don't care about the pain they would be in cuz
they left me in pain, they'll, all hug, each other and forgive each other and ask oh what what could we have done? i prayed i prayed for the help of my family
i begged for the help of my family, i begged for some kind of support, some kind of feeling that there were someone there cared
i would have helped my own family and what did time all i could, but instead i'm the one who needed help
my mom died in the same room in 2013
she died about five feet from where i'm laying
i wonder, i wonder sometimes if i could be with her if this ends
if, if i can at least be with my mom, i pray for it, i pray she'd
forgive me that she'd understand that the family that's left here is not it's not compassionate thought
they left me on my own
they gave up on me
that's all i'm ready to give up it
just comes a time when a person can't do this anymore when they need peace
i need peace
i need not to be destroyed mentally anymore
sorry, my videos got so dark
i pray that no one else has to go through this, but no one else ever has to feel feel how low this is
i pray that, for you, people out there i've run out of hope
