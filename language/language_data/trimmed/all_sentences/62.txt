i'm still alive shoot and a lot of people don't understand what suicide is
people don't understand what it's like to be a suicidal um one day, and so many things could cause you to be suicidal um, most of the time it's loneliness
as far as someone who's been dating - and you know it's been proven - women's standards are so high nowadays and they have no standards for themselves
so it's so hard for men to find a woman that the suicide
when you look at um what caused the suicides you'll see lots of times in men, it's because there's no good women out there and the men
men need a woman, and women are just so mean, and just badmouth men, all the time and emotionally destroy men
men can't take the pain and that's what suicide is about
it's about no matter whether it's that or something else it is about stopping the pain people think it's about making people feel sorry for you and i've heard people talk about suicide, like oh, i'm, too strong for suicide
how stupid that person would be to kill themselves like? oh i'm, gon na, kill myself and make everyone make everyone else feel bad for what they've done to me in beaubourg love is listening, this guy, not just laughing
i was like wow, you are so stupid for thinking that that's what suicide is about
it's about stopping the pain, it's about not being able to take it anymore, and it just becomes too much and for a lot of you, people that are suicidal
you could be in a room with a lot of other people that are suicidal and all actually understand the same feeling that you're all going through, but still be alone and still feel alone
now, in my case, besides the loneliness and knowing that i'll be alone for the rest of my life, it's also also a chemical disorder and that's what i just have to deal with and people it's so funny
when people hear you're suicidal, they think that you're gon na hurt other people, and i kind of laugh at that's like well, actually, the exact opposite
i want to help people, they don't accept my help and i think, what's the point of being around anymore
if people will not change for the better and not help themselves, do not learn
people are so stubborn in their ways and they try and prove what they want to believe
instead of trying to find facts and believe the facts and that's where it comes from for me, but there's so many different reasons
i i know people oh gosh
i keep myself together
i know people who've lost absolutely everything
i got my very best friend since i've had oh well, not best for anymore uh, but he's still good friend close friend since i was 19 and i lived with this gentleman for a while and he lost his kids and he lost his house
he lost his business, he lost his business, he lost everything and i was going to court at the time and i almost got about 20 years and then his brother came in and lived with us and what you had
you had a big, huge, beautiful house, with a big pool in the backyard and a waterfall and a jacuzzi and the most expensive toys
the guy was a millionaire you, you had a bachelor pad with three guys and we were all suicidal and we only had each other and the only thing that kept us from doing anything to ourselves was knowing that the other two would have to live with
that and the suicide is a selfish act, yes, but believe it or not people around you
if you were to do such a thing, you will put such a toll on for the rest of their lives
i was about to finally do it and actually this isn't stuff right here i went out to get these pills and now all the pharmacies were closed and and for some reason, with my phone when i sitting and something on the phone, i would i could look up the pharmacy to make sure they're open hit the call button and it would not detect my finger and then i would call someone else and it would call but no matter what pharmacy
it was
all the pharmacies, as soon as i hit touch, call all of a sudden
it no longer detected my finger and i dealt with it for about two hours and i called every single number that night, except the pharmacies numbers and then at the at the end of the night
i realized it was my best friend's birthday and i realized, if i had done it for the rest of my life
my best friend would remember on his birthday
this is the day that my best friend justin killed himself and i would have ruined that
for the rest of his life - and you see, there's people out there who you don't know this, but if you were to kill yourself, there are people out there who will blame themselves and maybe people you don't even know very well
