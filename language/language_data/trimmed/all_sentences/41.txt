it was at his house so yeah it was strange but um, so he moved to texas and with his new job he he couldn't get medical insurance, for, i think at least a month or 3 months, or something like that
so because he didn't have his medical insurance and he had this move, and you know you know that that costs a lot he couldn't at that point afford to get his expensive medication for his seizures
so he just wasn't taking it and i'm just i just look back and i think like like i had extra money i could have
i know i can't do this to myself, but it's like, i could have helped him or something i could have given him money and spotted him for his medication
but i didn't, i didn't know how serious it was so having you know, an issue with having seizures and not having his medication and not being on his medication
for a month i got a call one night from someone on nc a saying that they found chris's body
it was like the middle of the night, it was, i don't know it was after midnight, like 12:30 1:30, and they said they found his body and i just obviously broke down, and it's so weird, it's so weird when you have this person that you care about and you talk to them every single day and one day you just can't talk to them anymore
i know i don't cry about this anymore
i just also don't talk about it, and so i woke my parents up and i i was you know
i grew up going to church, so i told my mom like it was a saturday night
i think it was the 4th of october 4th or 5th of october
i don't one of those dates
i just cried to my parents and i i told them look
i need to go to church tomorrow like i need
i need something
i need something to feel better, i own, i don't know it was so hard to come bria and, if you've ever lost someone, i just remember being so depressed
i just wanted to sleep all the time i would take naps through the day and every single morning i wake up or anytime i'd wake up from a nap
i would remember that it's real and i would think like this
this can't be real
there has to be some way some way just to like reverse time and like stop it
there has
there has to be some way to make it, so this isn't real
this can't be real, and i remember just i i used to be so excited to get text from him every day and any time anyone would text or call me
my stomach would just drop and i'd get so sad because i knew would never beat him again and i would call his voicemail just so
i can dial this number and i remember i even texted his phone a few times even after it was gone just because it was so hard to think i'm never going to get another text on my phone with his name popping up or another call with his name popping up - and i was just so depressed - obviously that's not something everyone, everyone dies, everyone loses people, but not everyone loses someone that they love at such an early age
like you know, romantically love and i never even told him that i never got to
i always felt it
i always wanted to tell him that, but i never told him that and that's really difficult that i never got to say that to him and i, when i get depressed i can't eat like
i just had no appetite, and so i didn't eat or drink water, pretty much like very minimal food or water for a week or two
maybe it was a week and i woke up one morning
i think my dad was on a business trip, so i was sleeping in the room with my mom and i remember waking up one morning i was so dizzy and i walk out to the living room to my mom and she looks at me and she's like what is wrong with you - and i was just like - i don't know, and she said that my face was white
my lips were white
i was just pale as a ghost she says she said that i looked and i went to go into the bathroom and i just passed out
so she took me to the doctor and they had to hook me up to an iv all day long, because i was severely severely dehydrated
it was really bad and it's not like
i was trying to not eat or drink
i just like i said when i'm depressed it's really hard, and that was the most depressed
i've obviously ever been and then came his funeral
