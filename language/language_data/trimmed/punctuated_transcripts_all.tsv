64	You know that was my sister was my mom's first child, so she didn't really know why my sister was acting like this. She kind of just thought it was her acting out and just being a rebellious kid you know, but my sister would take things a little far, for example, running away or just doing pretty much, every bad thing that a parent is caution towards their child or, like Tries to prevent their child to do my sister did so pretty much. She would go out with friends and lie about where she was going or she would have the friends pretend to be say, their parents or something and lie about it. Something like that. Just pretty much all those horrible things there's no way many times and basically like I just needed to give y'all a little backstory of like my childhood and then growing up. Also, we didn't live in like a big fancy house or anything. We lived in like a two-bedroom apartment that was a very small apartment in New York. My sister, I don't think I don't think, did much when I was a kid in New York, but when we moved to where we live now, which is Georgia, my sister had been older and she started exhibiting signs, and you know there was just basically a lot Of fights that I experienced and they were pretty bad fights, that was just what I grew up with. I cried a lot growing up. I was very scared, a lot I'm trying to not cry either because I don't think it's really gon na do anything. If I cry, but I'm sorry, I cry moving on from that all my life. I I've also been very, very very protected and I don't believe I've been protected and the most healthiest ways. I think I've honestly been protected in the most worst ways possible. Like I said, my sister used the light of my mom a lot and pretty much not be a good child at all, and my mom took that out on me. She tried to prevent me from doing everything my sister did like she basically took everything that my sister did and then all the consequences that she might have given my sister or try to maybe give my sister she threw it on me also, and basically I was On to go out kind of mentioned this in some videos in a video before, I think it was my mom, but I didn't really go into as serious. It actually affected me because this is something that actually does affect me daily even now, and I'm 20 years old, I'm 22. I can't do anything, nothing on mom. Basically, never let me go out. I couldn't go to the movies. I couldn't go to the mall. I couldn't hang out with friends, I couldn't go to anybody's house, nobody would could come to ours and my mom never wanted to drive me anywhere. She would always say she was too tired after work um, which is understandable, yeah she was a single parent. She just had to take care of me and my sister, so she was tired and you know my mom does have her reasons for things I believe. Ultimately she does. My mom doesn't mean any harm, but I don't think she realizes a No most parents realize when they're doing wrong for by their kids, and I don't think my mom realized that for me, because she treated me as if I was a second version of my sister And I'm nothing like my sister. I don't think that's how you should treat kids. I don't think that's how someone should treat their kid and trust me. I mean I've gone I've spoken to the few friends I've had about this. I'Ve spoken to a therapist about this therapist wasn't even really an actual therapist. I mean I guess he was, but it was a counselor that they gave us through the school. That'S a whole other story, but I've tried talking to other people about this. They'Ve even tried talking to my own mother and I'm saying all of this before anybody tries to come at me and say: oh well, maybe you shouldn't post this. Maybe you should talk to somebody like I've tried and I feel like honestly, I'm at a point where I don't know who else to talk to, and so I was never really allowed to socialize. I wasn't allowed to pretty much do a lot of teenagers did growing up and, of course, I couldn't have a boyfriend either so on lately with learning things about people and experiencing like fake friends and experiencing how guys treat women and I'm I'm just late with all Of that and it sucks, because I'm not a point where mentally, I feel like I'm mature and should be in a relationship with a man that actually treats me right, but I've just been dealing with so many boys.

35	Hey how you doing, but I'm on much lately just been so weak. Sorry about that. Oh you guys who thought keep it up on post never did. I will have to turn my this I coming out and talking to you all anyways, I'm here to talk to you about suicide. One number one leading deaths in the u.s., probably even around the world, us we have main problem bowling suicide thousand main couple episodes reasons. Breakups social abuse, regular abuse, physical emotional, it happens gives a ton of reasons but happens mainly with teenagers. I believe nothing, not good, because those teenagers haven't lived. They haven't experienced all the life they've experienced. Can you fired from the first job or going on and marrying someone falling above some teenagers do get that not many most teenagers aren't married if they did 15 or anything, I'm sure as hell, not but suicide. It takes that stuff away from that person. We all can help that person out. You know we can talk to them, say what's up man, why are you struggling to you why you? Why are you crying last hour why you kind of work today we can talk to them. There'S many different ways. We can talk to them too. Don'T go straight up them yuck, and why are you crying don't do that? It'S not good. Try me not subtle, but it's easing to it. Don'T straight, go in, say why you crying today talk to that. I mean they're, probably not gon na, want to just go straight in just let them know you're there for them go to them. Tell them! I'M here got your back. If you need anything boss laying into you I'll, try and stand up for you, don't risk job but trying the person I now can get to whatever they're having problem with. Maybe they were divorced or having problems with financial. You know that maybe they're homeless they're not be able to support themselves with job. Maybe you offer you your room up to them with them half of the couch for a little while, so I can get back on their feet and sell the debt there, but also with teenagers. If you're walking on the halls and see someone crying don't just go. Okay, they're crying swords normal. It is normal, but it's not normal. Just to let it go. Don'T do that. You can help someone out many different ways being there. It'S number one way, always let someone know you're there for them. If you care about them, let them know that don't just blow them off. Many people go through many different things. Some are raked shot at beat it up. We'Re just called me names and that takes into them. It doesn't mean that you can just let it be. If you see you know someone, don't do something like that. Don'T let go you can't let that go. It'S not good. There'S all different types of suicides. We all know that some hang themselves. Some take pills, there's all different kinds. Tell it a friend of yours or someone, you know be one of those people on the list of suicide. Don'T let them be that number on the end of the year, nah suicides 2015. Don'T do that, try and help them out. Don'T let them be bullied, fired. They'Re fired, they may have been fired for a really good reason. So, just let him go home and just be homeless, maybe help them out. So many different things you can do. I want you all to drive for just one minute every day. Think of what you go to done, I love someone. You'Ve all upset. You can do that you'll be a better person every day. Thank you. You have a good day. You have anything got my email mean comment, section I'll put out my facebook and all that junk. You all ever need it down here. Just comment subscribe like be here every day.

63	I have some cuts right here and then I put a an alarm clock cord around my neck and I was going to hang myself but, as I said, I was drinking and I think that's what saved my life. I was too drunk to hang myself, but I attempted it and I passed out well, I took the cord offers and I passed out from the bleeding, but I was sort of still awake, and so I stumbled my way up the stairs to my friends room and He was dead asleep because a heavy sleeper and I ended up knocking over a dresser with my feet, my legs. Well, I was on the ground bleeding out and that woke him up and he was he was panicky. You don't know what to do and he was just screaming and he couldn't he hesitated. He didn't know whether or not to pick me up in the dark or turn off the lights. It took him a few seconds to actually turn on the lights and then, when he turned on the lights, he saw me there's blood everywhere on my arms and he said he was drinking too and he didn't know what to do. He was a drunk drunk, but he was drinking, so I could tell he was just hesitating to stay sober to get me to the hospital and then we drove there and on the way there. I opened my the car door, the passenger door and I attempted to jump out and he had to pull me back in. I think I was just really pissed off that I didn't worth the first time when I tried committing suicide because I was too drunk. I couldn't hang myself and then we got to the hospital and they had to do a cat scan. They had to check my neck because there was a huge like line going around it and I'll show you the picture right now. That is my neck right there. After the lion Clark, clock cord was um, it was wrapped twice around my neck and I went to go, hang myself with it, but it never worked and I will show you the cuts right now and if you don't like seeing cuts, don't look, but here are The cuts - this is what happened that night when I did that, and these are just a few hours after so they were pretty deep somewhere deeper than others, but most of them were just batches because I couldn't find a razor. So I used meat knife and I don't know if it was dulling out, but it was pretty sharp. I think I was just because I was drunk then I can go really deep and on the way to the hospital, the ER, my or I called my mom, and I was crying. You know screaming, and I called my brother as well and they all met me at the hospital, but only my mom could come back for some reason, so they just dropped me off and told me that they loved me and then they went home just to wait. What and see what would happen so I was in the ER for a few hours because we were waiting for a spot in miller devon, the place i was talking about where they keep people safe, and I was on a 72-hour hold and we had to wait For a spot, so I was in the ER for a few hours until I was wheeled over there and I spent five days there because on a weekend, weekends don't count as a 72-hour hold and my friends came and visited for a little bit and we went Over what would happen after this, and now I'm in ILP, which is intensive, outpatient therapy and it's maybe three times a week for three hours a day and I have to be in there for maybe three to six weeks. We don't know yet and yeah. That'S pretty much what happened and being in that mental health hospital. I was kind of going insane. Actually, it's kind of ironic that place was actually making me go psycho, but I learned a lot of things and there are a few people that were dealing with depression as well. But when I compared myself to them - and I know in the other video - I told you not to compare yourself with others, but with this compare myself with other people made me feel like my problem, so so small compared to others, and it made me happy in A way but at the same time, sad because I feel bad for them. So I was glad that I went to the mental health hospital to see different perspectives and now hopefully, after this ILP, I will be going to monthly or weekly sessions of therapy. With this christian-based place, but after I attempted my life, I traumatized a lot of my friends in my family, especially my mom, and doing that makes me feel it would help with my pain in that it doesn't matter what others think it's what you feel there's still Even my feelings pass on to other people - and I don't - I haven't - really really realized that until I actually attempted suicide, so I'm kind of glad that I did it in a way, but at the same time I really hurt my family. Now I have marks all of my arms in my legs and I'm kind of ashamed being out in public and people are gon na see these and I'm not I'm not ashamed at the same time, because you know this is my story, I mean this is what I went through at the same time. I don't want people thinking that I'm some depressed girls, that is faking her smile every day. Besides, that, I don't want to go into details and everything that I learned and I saw in Miller, duan the mental health hospital.
84	Hey guys, it's me out a bad day. Just got back from a psychiatrist. They were wanting to commit me Cove, it's not to put in the hospital this medicine, that's killing off these. Whatever from the Lyme disease thing, I've got me, I don't know. Side effects are bad, got me depressed and the parents want me to pack up and move to their house and sell my house and kept no insurance. Now no job, no partner, cuz, they don't even um yeah um. I don't know where I'm gon na end up. Just I don't know how much more I could take. We'Ve got everybody parents worried and I had to promise my psychiatrist. I wouldn't kill myself and just feel like crap, but I don't know when it's gon na end him. I just lost everything. I'Ve ever had my life, it seems, but I'm sorry, but how can I be happy, so I don't know that's where I'm at so I don't know. Maybe this is a good buy, but this just sucks and I can't take anymore. I just I can't take much

83	Hi I haven't recorded a video in a while then using another channel, but I forgot the passcode. I wanted to make this video to show people what suicide does. I know you already know as soon as say kills you obviously that's what, but it does a lot more. It breaks you completely. First, I have to say warning this may trigger some thoughts or actions that you may do to yourself. So if you are extremely triggered or scream extremely offended to suicide, do not watch this video. I haven't made up for this one. I sometimes do but right now not doing this for a lot of reasons to show people that I'm trying I'm trying not to do that stuff anymore, I'm trying to get better, but it's gon na be hard for me. I for people who don't know me. I have extreme suicidal thoughts and actions still have at wrist. I'Ve tried multiple times. Obviously every single one has failed. It hurts. It hurts a lot talking about this trying to express to people what this feels like see. A lot of people like the cut for the same thing right now, you're complete fucking idiots. You don't even have a reason, for you have a person in a band. That is not a reason for it. A lot of times. Suicide is caused by a lot of things changing around you, my father, I'm not gon na, say or anything suffered from well. He still is suffering from and alcohol an alcoholic and extreme depression. I have depression and anxiety, which all add up. It was one of the reasons why my parents got divorced a couple years ago. It hurt a lot and that's when I sort of spiraled into this phase, a lot of people call it the emo phase. Yes, it is email. I am very I'm very email, but I never really noticed any of the stuff going on around me and I sort of just tumbled in to my suicidal thoughts last year when I actually made those videos when I made I just watched the cinnamon challenge video. I didn't even know that I was like I've tried, choking myself, which I've done multiple times now, one notch with myself at Joker's, and that's why, on my old page, I actually had to take it down, because I was getting so much hate on it. I made a video video stuff video about the choking yet because it's so stupid, but at the same time I was choking myself almost every day. It was an addiction. I almost did take full doses of painkillers. Try to kill myself, someone caught me and yeah that whole thing went down. I'Ve been called multiple things by the person, my father, who doesn't even know that I have suicidal problems. He just thinks I'm Brad. He just thinks I'm a golf brat and see a lot of people on the internet saying that they don't have a reason. They all have a reason to kill themselves. I feel fucking reason depression. All around me, people calling me things. I have voices in my head. I know I sound like insane right now telling me go, kill yourself. No one fucking cares. No one loves you. No one cares about you. No one would care about you if you died. People would just kick you around and treat you like peace shit like they already do, wouldn't care at all. My mom found out about my suicidal thoughts. My school counselor told her and one of my best friends told her town that people really do care. A lot of people have changed my life and my actions about myself. So this is the video to kill people if you're thinking about committing suicide or have suicidal thoughts. Do it too in July, it takes a hold of you and it some people just do it for pity. That'S all they do it for this giveaway bullshit. I don't want to show you me crying anymore, but I just want to make this video just show people what it does educate. People like you shouldn't, kill yourself, and you shouldn't do this to yourself. Thank you for putting on this video 
67	Um tear on this card um. Basically I was wanting something. I'Ve been really hurt for a while, and I've tried so many times to give up and it hasn't worked, and I you know if someone wants to kill himself, they would probably do it like they would find a way, and maybe because I failed, it was probably Because I didn't want to just yet - or I wasn't ready to stop myself somehow right now, I feel ready. I feel like I'm just a waste of time to everyone and that I fucked up so many times that I just like it's it's getting frustrating to myself and other people. So I've got some 100. I don't really know what to drink with it. Probably dinner teacher um, but doesn't matter if we just end up fucking dead after because I don't really want to deal with going back into hospitals anymore. So that's how I want to do. I don't want to spend my life in hospitals or treatment, centers or sad. I don't want to be sad forever, plus I want to be with my dad because he died. So it's kind of unfair to me that I'm just here he is there, I mean we were really close and it's not fair and I don't know - maybe it's not fair that I'm going to do this and everyone's just going to be stuck here. But hey people deal with things differently. I guess I just do it in a bad way. Some people just aren't cut out for this whole fight shit, and I honestly I truly loved every single one of you that I met. Maybe I was an asshole to some of you, but this I don't know, maybe I see it easier taking it out on you, because you deal with things good. I don't know Alex over chefs key. You were my boyfriend for almost eight months, and that was my first real boyfriend or I didn't know how to deal with. I didn't know how, to date, like I honestly didn't know how I'm surprised, honestly, that I losted that long, because you took my shit, you dealt with my shit, you fucking handled it for me, like I, don't know how you did that, like you were so into My problems that I feel felt like I didn't even have any at the time, and maybe that's what I missed. Maybe I missed having those problems, because I just hate putting that burden on people and I'm really sorry Alex. I was so confused. This is the one thing that I hate that I am so confused. You know I'm not against gays or lesbians, I'm not at all. It'S just it's just confusing when it comes to yourself and what you want, because I'm always so indecisive about what I want. You know - maybe I am straight or lesbian, I don't know my mom says: there's really no such thing as sexual, but I guess she just says that because she's straight and she doesn't know really, it is so uncomfortable and I'm sorry I don't mean to hurt any Of you by doing this, I really don't I'm just so sad, so I guess this is goodbye seriously. I love you all so much even Alex fuck. I know I cheated on you. I lied to you and I said some freaking hurtful things to you. What I still do, love you and you can no right to tell me what I care about what I don't care about, because I too care probably too much and maybe that's why fuck you up and that's why I broke up with you because I didn't want To hurt you anymore and now, maybe if I keep living then I'll just continue to hurt everyone around me. What if I do this I'll hurt you all one more time and that's it. Goodbye 
16	They asked me if I wanted some. I said no because I didn't smoke weed like that. Like I've tried it before, but like in this time of high school, I wasn't I've never been a person to just like smoke weed, so I was just like no I'm good blah blah anyways. We after we picked up the weed. We ended up dropping off. All of his friends off at their houses and then me and this boy went to a yogurt place to get some frozen yogurt, so we're sitting there eating our first neighbor. We actually ate it in his car, and I remember we were talking and something about me. Like a very characteristic that I kind of wish I didn't have, is that I'm a very flirty person, I'm not purposely a flirt, but I just am actually like overly nice to people, and usually it gets me in trouble with guys that they think I'm flirting with Them and I'm not really meaning to but, like I said before, when I started the story, this guy was just a friend to me. I never really saw him in that kind of romantic way. Anyways I could tell he was flirting with me and I knew like I was flirting with him but, like I said he was a friend, so I didn't really cared like if it came off as flirting. I don't know, I'm just I'm just a flirty type. I don't really I just I don't know I never really liked. I always flirt with people, but nothing really ever happens with it. You know you just flirt and it's just like. Oh, that girl flirted with him before you're gon na, be it's not a big deal. Anyways we're just chilling in his car and he was like okay, you only take you home and I was like yeah like okay, let's go home, so I have to read the frozen yogurt. We went to my house and at my house there's a park across the street from my house, but, like you, can still see my house from the park anyways instead of driving to my house. He was like. Oh let's drive up here. Real quick, like I just want to see what's over here, so he drives to this park. You have to kind of like go up a hill to get to the park he drives to the park and we just chill in his car we're just talking. There'S another car at the park already and they were just chilling. Do you mind it's around 6 o'clock now kind of getting late outside kind of getting dark, we're just chilling in his car and we're talking and then things kind of got carried away um. He kissed me and guys like it. This boy is not ugly. This guy was actually really cute. He was a friend, you know, I just never thought of him that way, but I was just like you know what hey, why not I? What like you know, I wasn't it wasn't a bad thing that kissed me, so we start making out and that's as far as I thought things would go like us making out. You know I never really hung out with him outside of school. Besides talking to him. After school, but I never really hung out with him so we're just we just start making out and I'm thinking us as far as it's going to go, considering we've never had like a real conversation like I don't even text this guy after school. You know I mean so we're making out for about 10 minutes when this guy says do you want to make out in the backseat, because, like the way we were making out his like, he had like a a console, a center console, and it was really huge. So we're like leaning over it, so it's kind of really uncomfortable, so he was like. Do you want to go to the backseat and like make out - and I was like sure like why not you know what like we're already making out? Why not he's a good kisser? I don't mind it: let's, let's do it, so we hop into the backseat and we start making out once again and then we stop because he asked me like if I want to give him a massage, and I was like boy no, I'm not about to give You a massage, like you, give me a massage, I probably at this point sure just went home and not giving any massages or taking any massages, but he starts to give me massage she's massaging my back and it doesn't really get anything crazy. Just massaging me and I'm laying down on his seat and he's like straddled on top of me. So this is me laying down and then he's like sitting like that on top of me and he's massaging my back after of like 10 minutes, he stops and he was like okay, you're gon na give me a massage, and I was like you know what. Why not I suck at massages like it, took him along just to convince me to give him a massage, because I literally stuck at massages, but I was like you know what why not. So I start giving him a massage. So after about five minutes of me, massaging him um, he decides to flip over so like right now he's on his back and I'm on top of him Charlotte, like this five minutes later, he like flips himself this way so now I am like straddled. On top of this boy's penis area and like yeah, he leans up and he starts kissing me and we're making out and I'm basically like straddling this guy. Basically, but, like I didn't mean to put myself in this position, it just that's. He flipped that way, and now that's what was happening when we were making out once again, I didn't think I was going to go any further than us making out like. I said I never really talked to this guy like that, and I really flirted with him like that. It was always just friendly conversation, so we started making out and eventually I'm kind of getting tired of it. Like you know, it's like when you make out with someone too long, it's like okay, either something's gon na happen next or it's gon na stop there. So in my head, I'm like it's gon na stop, so I pulled him out. I pull back and I'm just like. Okay, like I think, I'm gon na go home now it was like no like just stay just stay and I was like no, I probably should go home. I got a feeling that you might be. Do I tell you? Oh, you can tell me if or wrong girl. I think you might be 
4	I need to share this story of what happened to me and something that has impacted my life every single day, since it happened five years ago, one of the people I cared about in the world the most um. This is when it gets hard. It took her own life. This is why I haven't been able to film it. This is coming from somebody that has had those thoughts, somebody that has had to get a lot of help because of having those thoughts. I'M not gon na tell the story of how it happened or what happened, because I don't think it's fair to her and I don't think it's fair to me and I don't think it's fair to you guys, but I just kind of want to sit for a Little bit and talk about what it's like, after what it's like, leaving the people that love you behind, even when you feel like nobody loves you, because it sucks the way that I've described losing a friend to suicide is basically when you love somebody, you give them A little piece of your heart and when people break your heart I mean you eventually get that little piece back. You find that piece and you're able to kind of mend your heart, but when you lose a friend to suicide, especially you don't ever get that little piece back. It'S like this empty little hole in your heart that eats away at you forever. It'S always confusing, and it doesn't make sense, and I know how she was feeling before she took her own life, because I've been in that place where I thought that was an option, and I thought that was something that would make things better. And I thought that would just fix all my problems and I it doesn't use everybody that you care about with so many more. I guess all I can say to somebody that's contemplating any in their own life. Is that you can't, I didn't feel like you. Can I know you feel like it's gon na fix everything I know from my friend. I can't even imagine the amount of pain that she went through before she decided to make this decision this permanent decision that can never be taken back and I'd suck at first. I didn't believe it was real. I spent a lot of time convincing myself, it wasn't real and it didn't happen and then, for a long time I was angry because the friend that was always there for me. It wasn't there for me through this. They weren't, even here it's like the worst heartbreak ever because it can't be fixed. I know before she entered her own life, she felt like nobody loved her and that nobody was going to love her. It'S not true. When you take your own life, you rob yourself of all these people in the future that want to love you and want to know you and want to be around you. When you take your own life, you don't even give it a chance. You don't give it a chance to get better. You don't give these people that are waiting for you that you haven't even met a chance to love you, you don't give happiness a chance, and I understand how hard it is. I have been there and I've had those thoughts and I've had to get help for those thoughts and it's the hardest thing. It'S the hardest thing to try to convince yourself to stay alive when you feel like the only option is to end it. But I promise you, I absolutely promise you that it's worth it and that it does get better, even if it feels like it does, even if you feel like you're stuck and you're gon na feeling forever. It'S not true, because people are just gon na miss you. So much and they're gon na miss you forever. I know if you're in that position that this sounds like a load of shit. I know because if you would have told me when I was going through that that I would have the friends I have now and I would have this chosen family that I didn't even know could exist. I wouldn't have believed you. I would have thought it was a load of crap. I would have thought everyone was completely bullshitting me, but it's honestly, so true is, if you are in the position, when you were so heartbroken by the world, that you think you need to take your own life. It means you have a heart that is so full of pain, which means it can be so full of love. It means that you're somebody that feels a lot and loves a lot, and it's a disservice to the world to leave. If you're one of those people, you think that ending your own life will make things better, but in reality it just makes this dark world a little bit darker. When we need it your light, my life was so much brighter with her in it, and I still convinced myself that she's out there and that it didn't happen and that she's just quietly living a life where she's happy but she's, not she's, not here anymore.
44	Hey guys, it's Molly Albrecht and today we're back with a serious video. This is not like any of the videos that I've made in the past, and this is not going to be all fun and spunky, like the blogs that I've been making. I'Ve already filmed this video twice, and this is now my third attempt to try to film this video, I'm here to spread awareness, because I feel like suicide is something that people think that they need to hide, and I feel like the more that people feel like They need to hide the fact that they are feeling suicidal bit more, that suicide actually happens and more that people attempt and the more that people feel like they're alone. So I feel like when I come here to talk about this very serious topic, that more people can feel open to speak about their own experience to me or to other people around them or even come to YouTube and make their own video like I've, been inspired By Sabrina trans, I go to school with her and she made a video similar to this, and it really inspired me to make me push through and make this video. Once again, I don't even know where to start, if you new to my channel, I'm Molly Albrecht um, I do makeup, I'm a freelance makeup artist and I have a lot of dreams and hopes for my own future. I hope to one day move to LA and to pursue doing makeup in Hollywood or come back here and pursue your makeup here in Colorado. Either way I want to go to school in LA, and I want to pursue makeup in any way that I can. So how did this all start so in elementary school? I was bullied for having glasses. Kids would call me ugly. They would call me fat, so here's one pair of the glasses that I used to wear a lot of the time. This, I believe, was the pair that I wore a lot in fourth third grade and then this pink pair here was the pair that I wore a lot in fourth grade. So I was bullied a lot and elementary school and I feel like it is the main reason why I feel so down on myself still and never confident and never feel like. I'M enough, I feel as though it's hard it's a reason why. I also have a lot of hard times making friends too, as a child. I have repressed memories. I don't know if you guys know what that means, but it means basically just like. I have memories of a time and an instance that happened that you're not quite sure if it happened, because it's forgotten. So basically, you shut it out of your mind completely, and then it comes back through dreams and you think it could be a memory or it could not be a memory or it's just a continuous dream that keeps happening. So that happens with me and something that people call molestation, not a fun topic and not something that people are very open about either, and so I remember distinctly when I was a child. I remember it had started, or I remember from what I can remember me asking this family member. If you can get pregnant from yourself and said no, and then I just everything after that was blank, and I don't remember anything. The other thing that I do remember is that I would get scared at night. My feeling member would say, hey coming to my bed and you can just hang out with me and I would be like yeah okay, I get rid of whatever problem I have in my own bed and I go and I'd sleep with them and I can't I Don'T have a memory of ever getting inside the bed after I got inside. I have no memory at all as to what happened afterwards and those memories came back around 7th grade. 6Th grade was the time that my dad started getting to gather with my stepmom and they started getting really super serious, and I remember that that December he had proposed to my stepmom, and it was also 6th grade was also the first year that I haven't ever Gotten Instagram and with children in Instagram, they're gon na follow whoever account they want to follow. So for me, I followed depressed pages and so reading. Through all those messages made me develop a habit of picking up a razor. My first time, picking up a razor was in sixth grade. I was upset about something I don't remember exactly what it was, but that was the first time that I had ever picked up a razor and I slit my wrists. It was one of those feelings where I felt relief and, like I wanted to continue, and to this day I still cannot break the habit of whenever I feel sad or whenever I feel guilty or whenever I feel like I deserve it.
37	Hello YouTube. I just wanted to say first of all that this is not and never will be, a click beat video. I was thinking about making this video earlier, but it just happened. I ended up taking a nap to get my mind off things and now that I'm awake really trying not to cry. I don't even know how I am crying because I feel like I have like no tears left, but I woke up from my nap and I expected to feel better. I expected to feel better, but I'm not I feel worse than before. I went to sleep. I feel like complete trash, and I don't know if this is gon na - be a good thing that I'm putting this video out on the Internet. I don't know if it's gon na be a bad thing, but I feel horrible. I know about none to little people or even gon na see this video. I feel like it's hard to talk to people in person. One-On-One face-to-face but saying it on video is so much easier. I don't know how, just as I guess before you ask in the comments and my old medications am I getting help? Yes and yes, I take an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer I take both in the morning and I take foods that night. I do have an appointment to get a new counselor because I haven't been counseled in the past. I want to say three months, but yes, I do have an appointment for that. I don't know. I just feel like absolute trash. It'S like sometimes, I feel, physical pain from being alive and the days that I majorly depressed. I also feel pain from even moving, and I can tell you this right now it does suck to suck. I feel like are nothing to know what I've been diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, depression, anxiety and bipolar, so the moments that I am happy, it doesn't last long at all, but the moments that I'm sad and feel like killing myself. It seems like good, they last forever, not happy with my life, I'm not doing anything with it. So, what's the point of being here, you know I graduated so none in school, I'm currently taking a gap year until I go to college and they I feel like it's taking forever. I just I feel like it's taking forever for college to get here for having my own car to get here for just pure undeniable happiness to get here. I just feel like it's taking forever. You know people say it does get better. Well, when please tell me one because it has almost been 10 years for me for me, it has almost been an entire decade for happiness to come, for this pain to move away - and I know this video isn't gon na get like any views. I mean that doesn't matter to me, it's just that they want friends to talk to. I want people to hear me out. There'S a lot that whoever's listening out there healing this video there's a lot. Pat, you don't know this video says little to nothing about me about what I've been through right now. I can truly tell you that being alive sucks, it really does right now, as you can see, I'm laying my bet just feels like I have nothing to live for, so why not just go you know I can feel the tears like coming up, but they're, not You know like coming out because, like I said I just feel like I don't have any more left, there might be a little wetness like I just rubbed away, but I was anything that I literally have no tears left to cry. Let'S slide them all out. You know it's whatever I guess on the inside I kind of crumble at the thought of being happy. You know being around people being alive because it's like I've only experienced that for maybe a few hours at most, but the thought is it happening everyday. It'S just like yeah right. Never in my life will that happen. Of course, some moments in the day I'll be like really happy and like fine with everything content with everything in my life and then a few moments later, you could all just come crashing down. Honestly. I feel like I'm not worth it I'll feel like who cares if I die I'll feel like just take me now and it's hard dealing with these thoughts. It really is because it's like who cares, you know like really anyone lis cares about me about my safety about my life. Sorry, the camera is moving right. Now I literally I'm shaking so bad. Sometimes I think, would my family be happier if I was gone, would people even care it sucks that you can't? You know see that part of your life it sucks. You can't see what goes on after you die. You know, but I feel like all this would stop. If I just I feel like all, this would stop. If I just went oh eight, I feel like all this would stop. If I just went away, was it here anymore? What'S not alive wasn't just sitting around doing nothing with my life. You know I barely go to work, they barely scheduled me. I don't really do any activities. I mean I do do cheerleading, but that's only two of the seven days. So I'm really just sitting on my ass doing nothing thinking about this type of shit. You know I'm just not happy. 
12	Everyone was telling us it's gon na, be fine. It'S not that bad and then it randomly just went to stage 4 and then he randomly um just passed away. One night and I woke up to firemen and people inside my house, carrying my dad out and my sister just crying on me and my brother. Just trying to hold me down I've never even accepted it. I don't know, I don't know if the hardest part for me is that I don't feel like. I can remember my dad. I know really um. I just feel like I'm just I don't know. I just haven't alright um, so after he passed away, I was already having a lot of issues in school and stuff because I'm Dyslexic - and I never wanted to do anything - that's school hot for me like to offer. I'Ve always wanted to either do entertainment or music, and I would get bullied a lot because I used to dress really weird. I used to wear hats and skinny jeans and all and look how I look like pretty much today. So I get bullied a lot. So I would, after my dad passed away, I would go to therapy and stuff for about four, maybe three years. I don't I think three years and I would have to go pretty much once every three days or something like that and it was pretty miserable because they would always have to like check my weight and stuff because they thought I was too skinny and then I'd Feel bad about myself and I feel like I'm, not gaining weight, I'm not eating healthy enough, I'm too skinny and there was just a lot of bad things happening that year, those years it was like about four years that was really depressed. I went to, I think three institutions for like a week each and one was really scary one. I had a stay there and it was like actually crazy people and they're like no offense to crazy people, but they're people that, were you, know, little loony and I actually got thrown in there. I got thrown in thought. I was gon na get killed by a guy for no fucking reason, which was really scary, and I think that guy was my roommate. If I can remember, it was really fucking scary - and I remember talk to my mom and being like - I need to get the fuck out of here because they're some guy that wants to kick my ass and then next thing. I know he got kicked out because I told the people so I was safe. I think I'm fine now, but that was really scary. That scared the shit out of me, and I think I was there for you cuz. I was so depressed that I wanted to kill myself and um. I don't know, I think I I remember when I was there, I would um want to uh get out and then just kill myself like right. The day I got out, I was just like I'm gon na kill myself, and there are many like times where I tried to I. I would just I just remember, I'm sitting on my house like the roof of it and just thinking and just wanting to jump off like and just fucking end it, but for some reason I did it because I felt there was a little light at the end Of this road like there was just a reason for me to keep on pushing, even though my life was feeling like complete and utter crap, and I didn't think I didn't think anything would get better. I don't feel like I'm gon na get too much into my past right now, um. I don't know why one! I can't really remember it right now, I'm overwhelmed which happens to me a lot. I always forget my past, which is kind of weird but yeah. I just I was just I was really mean. I was just a bad kid back, then I was really misunderstood and I treated my family like crap and I treated a lot of things like crap and I just had a lot of bad things happen and I don't really feel like getting into those right now. Yeah, so suicide and all that and cutting it fucking sucks guys it's it's the worst pain.

27	So lately I'm gon na head to this. I feel feeling to past and, like I wan na, kill us. I have three really good, descriptive reasons why I wanted this. I don't care if you guys Kirsten you're lying to sell kitchen you're lying Cheers you're. It'S not true Kirsten. You shouldn't do this, you shouldn't you're just lying. I know you're, not gon na. Do it you're too stupid you're too regular to do it. No, I want to, and let's start with reason one moment I start every fight. I start fights at home my mom and be like Kirsten look. What you've done you're the one who started this. I start friends it I start fights at school, I'll, say one little bitty word and it'll be a giant blood. It would be all cuz of me number two. I know I'm stupid, I know I'm worthless. I know I know nothing like nobody can do anything with me. Anything to help me and nobody in this whole way. Well, not even parents or family can change my mind about that number. Three. Everyone would be better off without me, they wouldn't noticed notice, I'm gone and everything would be. Okay, like I know, I'm sad and I know I'm too passed and I know they're worried, but if that's how I feel - and I really want to kill myself - it's not going to be their fault like it's not their fault. I should take the blame on me because I'm the one who started all this and very soon, I'm probably gon na, have to end all of it bye guys. Hopefully I don't but

It looks a year yeah Titus, that every damn i'm trying to make phone calls and body is so on. 
90	Oh boy, it's Sunday. Yes, it's Sunday and I'm very tired right now. It'S 10 o'clock 10:05! Actually in the p.m. and you know I had a relatively good day, but at the same time I'm in another one of my downloads, I feel hopeless. Again. I don't know why I just really feel like I'm not doing it and it may just be the tiredness talking, but I feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel and I feel like the more I try, the less success I feel like. I'M getting ever since my mom's come home with my dad she's been in control of what I eat, and I thought that would be a good thing, but sadly now I don't know what I'm eating and I'm not comfortable, not knowing I'm not comfortable. I, like my calorie counting system that I had because I knew what I was getting and I knew what I was doing and now I'm not in control of it and I'm getting ticked off. So my mom makes the foods that she knows I like, but the problem with the foods she knows. I like is that they're not exactly the foods I need to eat and they're, not exactly the healthiest. You have this casserole, it's a little beautiful my favorite castle. It'S my favorite food. It'S a comfort, food and thing about comfort. Foods is they're very high in calories. What it is is it's two cans of cheddar soup, two cans of cream of chicken soup like crave cheddar cream of chicken. Six chicken breasts cut up two cans of rice, and this is a double batch. Of course, two cans of rice. Do you put potato chips on top as like a crust, and you cover that in cheese. I love it. I do it tastes, it's amazing, but I overeat it and I can't even control myself when it comes to that. I have no control over anything right now. I can't control what I'm eating. I can't control myself from how much I eat. I can't control my weight. I was doing so well and now I feel hopeless and um. I'Ve been looking through my videos and I think my highest views is eight. Eight views is my highest and that's okay, I'm okay with that, but I feel like I'm not really talking to anybody and I'm feeling like no one's there for me and it's hard for me to stay motivated, trying to keep myself more of it by doing this, But I don't know if I can do it. If no one else supports me um, I'm just scared. I want to go to university and I want to have this great student life where I am suave and I get work done and you know be successful, but the way I look. No one takes me seriously and I don't know what to do, and this is one of my few I'm depressed episodes. I don't have depression. I don't suffer from anything, I'm just depressed right now and I don't know if there's anything I can do no. I need to talk to my mom. I need to tell her straight to her face mom. I love that you're cooking and I love that you're enjoying that you're cooking again. But can you please cook food for me with me in mind because you'll find ways to justify it like today she said: oh, but there's lots of protein in there. That'S fine, but if you could give me the protein in a way that doesn't help me gain weight, I broke my rule and I checked in on my weight today and I'm back up at 328. I'Ve gained three pounds: um, that's not right and I'm getting very frustrated at that um because I lost 20 pounds in two weeks. If you remember that, and now we're just over a month in I'm starting to gain again and I'm royally pissed and today is the day after I post this video, so I guess tomorrow will be the day that I post on Facebook, that I'm doing this and I'M going to get probably one more viewer, but at least the people who see it will know what I'm doing they'll see what I'm doing and maybe lend a hand. I'Ve been asking on my videos. If someone would make a comment to. Let me know that you're out there apparently not and I'm sorry I don't mean to be this guy, but in a way I need to um, but I'm going to go to sleep and I'm going to think happy thoughts. When I wake up tomorrow, I'm gon na start over again and I'm going to Regt myself again. So I can keep myself sane and I can keep myself living. Losing weight looks right now, I'm not in a good place anyways. I need to heartily thank you for watching today. Some of these more depressing videos are no harder to look through, but these are the realities of what I'm feeling and no it's not glamorous, and I'm not always the happy guy that people see at school. This is my other side. This is the side that comes out when I feel like my back's to a wall. So with that in mind, have a good night slaughter and I hope to see you tomorrow, 
29	First of all, I want to apologize to each and every single one of you that subscribes to authentic mental health and who is watching this video I right now so depressed. I feel just terrible and in this video I just want to explain how I feel I just want to be real. I just want to be open and I just want to be honest. I'M sick of feeling like this - and I think this video in a very strange messed-up way can help some of you that are watching this. I don't know many of you can relate to this video. I'M sure many of you feel how I'm about to tell you how I feel so for those of you that are subscribed to my other channel. You will already know this, but for the people that are I'll, explain to you a bit about what happened this weekend. So this weekend I took my girlfriend and my grandma away for a weekend. You know just to get a break. I wanted to treat my grandma and my girlfriend I didn't want to leave. My grandma at home had fantastic time stayed in a fantastic hotel and it was just you know a perfect weekend. Couldn'T have been better really and I got home a couple of hours go and I just you know, broke down, I it's difficult for me to even begin to tell you how I'm feeling right now. First of all, I feel ashamed and I know that's a bad thing. I feel ashamed that I feel this way and although it is not nothing to be ashamed of feeling this way, I just feel ashamed. Everyone always says you shouldn't be ashamed to be depressed or anxious or suffer from a mental illness, and I say that myself. I'Ve said that on many videos you shouldn't be ashamed, but you can't help but feel ashamed. You can you, I feel ashamed. I feel like nobody can relate to me. I feel, like nobody understands why. I feel this way. I feel like I've, let everybody down. First of all, I feel like I've, let you down, I feel like I've, let everybody on this channel down feeling this way. I just feel like I should be not a role model, because that's not that's not how I see myself and this channel. I just feel that when you watch me, you come to me to be feel comfortable and relate to me, but not just that. But I want to feel like I'm helping you and when I make a video like this. It makes me ashamed because I'm not really helping you am. I I'm just expressing how I feel, and I don't want to push my feelings onto you so once again, I'm so sorry I feel like I've, let my girlfriend down. You know. I love make so much with everything and she means the world to me, but I feel like I can't give her the life that she deserves. She deserves to travel, the world have a happy life, have Ferrari cars and Lamborghinis many massive houses. Although money isn't everything, that's how much? I think that she deserves because she's fantastic and when I feel like this, I can't I can't give her what she wants. So I feel you know ashamed and guilty and let her down feel like I've, let my family down. I feel as if you know I have a fantastic life. You know I have everyone around me that loves me all my family. They look and care for me. I just and when I feel like this, I feel like I've. Let them down and I feel like I'm, a failure in life. I feel like I'm a failure, because I feel this way and I don't know I don't have any answers as to you know, to stop feeling this way. I mean it's difficult for me to look at the camera, because I feel better shame that I don't really want to look into your eyes, even though I can't see you, but you can see me and I just I just feel totally devastated and ashamed.

13	My dad never came, he stayed in New York, can't say I blame him, but that that might be a factor as to how I am and why I am the way I am today so anyway move to Delaware with my mom and her new job. That was probably where things got the toughest for me at six years old. I spent a lot of time alone, a lot of time alone and I then started to kind of get into more creative things like drawing and reading, and I became very independent because I had to be. I learned to cook to clean, to do my hair to dress myself to do everything if you've ever watched the movie Matilda. Besides the leak, the obvious superpowers and the siblings - and you know the III was Matilda, so I did everything alone and you start to gain a sense of Independence and at the same time, you start to become very untrustworthy. You start to, you know, be become very comfortable in your aloneness, so it was very hard. I would say, to make friends and have meaningful connections with people, because I didn't know that you know um, I didn't have any siblings and I didn't really. It wasn't very. Very close to my family, and so when it you know when I started school, I was that awkward child that didn't know how to have friends that are creative kid that was always drawing. I was very quiet, extremely shy. It was terrified to talk to anyone to the lunch lady. I couldn't order my lunch. I couldn't do a lot of normal things, because I was scared um. I was really scared. I was always scared that my mom would leave me. I was very scared. If you alone, I thought I was chopped it um. She didn't look like anyone in my family. It was just it's not a good space for a child growing up and you know kind of developing their ideas of the world and how they see it and how I thought it was just a scary place and don't trust anyone and don't you know. So don't that's literally my don't don't do this? Don'T do that you'll fail you'll! You know that's not what you're much to do and and Brown girls are about to succeeded, we're not smart and all of that type of stuff that you learn at a young age and by the time I got to high school, I started to realize that. Okay, maybe there's something in this and in this aloneness and you know I started to get friends and you know, make real connections with people after I started to realize that they're, not as scary as I thought they were, and people aren't trying to hurt me and It'S okay too, to trust other people and so yeah. I started to get you know my friends and I started actually taking art classes and things like that and kind of trying to see what it is that I want to do with my life, because when I was younger, I always thought I would be a lawyer And I still, I still almost regret it not doing it, because I just have a passion for research and in law and helping people and and all that kind of thing, and so anyhow, that's when I started to realize. Okay, I am different and that's all right. You know um after high school and in mind you I. I was the kind of kid where I I didn't do not say I didn't do well in high school, but I didn't think it was important and I still sorry and all the high school it was out there. And maybe you shouldn't listen to me, but it wasn't that important um. I kind of skim by. I got a trouble, a lot I was suspended, often just for I wasn't a violent kid, but I I was very opinionated and I had a lot of opinions about a lot of different things and I would let my teachers know it, and so I'd get kicked Out often, I'd be suspended out of school suspension, in-school suspension - I I was pretty much an average student. I didn't do any of the homework I didn't believe in homework. I couldn't concentrate on my homework and but I did very well on the tests, because I kind of did that outside research and I kind of I really paid attention while I was in class. I just didn't want to carry that on once I left class.
34	Hi, this is completely unplanned, I'm tired of my life, so I wouldn't say just recently, maybe like distant past, I don't know my life has gone down the drink. I feel like I've spun out of control and I can't do anything about it. You know I'm going. I don't know where I'm going with this, I feel like. I just need to talk, and then a lot of words will come out. First, we're not gon na address how childish my room is. I am a kid at heart, so, whatever second, I really want to die and here and let me tell you why it all started senior year of high school. I don't know why I've been so depressed. Okay, I think. Maybe it's just the transition into adulthood or, like I don't know my entire life. I'Ve been controlled up and down by my parents. I'Ve never been able to make decisions for myself. So you know sad to say and kind of I don't even know like boo, but like codependent, like you know, I was very dependent on my parents and I cared what they thought. I cared what they would think about what I would be doing and especially when it came to becoming an adult and going to college, and they had all these high expectations. For me at first I had everything together like I was like I'm going to college. I got accepted into Penn. State like this is great whatever, but when I needed help, nobody, nobody helped me okay and not saying like. I wanted it right here right now. I wanted out but like when I needed to help and I was open to actually starting out everything. Nobody went to hell me and I just like I got here. I got here I'm here, you guys are being proud of me to my face telling me that everything's gon na be fine but you're not doing anything. To help me. I ended up not being able to go not being able to go because you know anyway. Sorry, you know not being able to go because money problems. No look. I just felt like nobody would help me. Okay, but the thing is I put myself there. You want to know why, because this dumbass never asked anybody else other than my unreliable parents for help. Okay, I don't know if you guys can hear that, but annoying a lot of people that I knew try to reach out. I wouldn't say a lot of people. My best friend's family was very is still is actually very kind to me and they've offered to help me on multiple occasions. Why, like? Where are they coming from like that? Okay, I think it's gone, that they were very kind and they were all you know. You know if you ever need help come to me. We know how to help you dog cuz. My best friend Artie, is in college and she's. You know figuring out her life and I'm just here not asking for help and that's the thing like a lot of people have so much pride like right now I came to the conclusion like. Why am I like not asking these people who have offered me help for help? The reason why I was so stagnant and not asking for help? It was because I found myself so deep in, like I wouldn't say negative emotion like you know the whole time I've been motivating myself like telling myself. I can do this I can get through this, like you know, trying to be an to mist, which is something I'm not very good at, but I've been trying and it's helped a lot. You know to boost my confidence and to motivate me to actually put my foot forward and get this on the boat. You know what I'm saying: where was I at? What was they even talking about? Oh, I was in like such a deep dark place and I laid myself constantly um like well.
76	Hey everybody. How are you guys doing I wanted to? I guess, make a video of how I'm kind of feeling right now, because I'm feeling absolutely useless as a person, and I not sure exactly how to explain how I I really feel. But if I was to be a hip or hit by bus all right now, I would be perfectly okay with that and I got my hands are falling. It'S freaking pathetic, so I been to watching some TV and I don't know it just smacked me across the face, as most feeling usually dude, there's no real reason for it. You know the movie that I was watching was happy and everything, and then it ended up that there's just this moment in the movie, where it's kind of like yeah God. Definitely what I would have really had and it's something that I don't think that I will ever ever get because my mental status is so far off and I think it's it's not necessarily. I mean it was a relationship kind of movie. Okay, but I mean it wasn't it's not all that, though it's kind of like what I'm contributing nothing at all and by me, putting myself out here explaining to everybody. What'S going on, I'm putting myself out here for a world of hurt, and I want to do this - not for that purpose of course, but I want to do this because I don't think people understand really what it feels like to have. You know depression and have had it, for you know: you're a whole entire life. I mean, I think everyone goes through bouts of it. Every you know now and then, and they bounce right out of it but being in a constant state of it is, is very mentally draining. And I don't like it. I don't like the fact that my meds aren't working, but I'm going through the side-effects of every one of them. I don't want to do it anymore. I don't I don't like the state of where I'm at, and I know that I am the sole person responsible for where it is I'm located and in this life, but I don't really have the mental capacity to change it, so it kind of throws basically my Whole entire life into turmoil probably will be for the next couple days. I would think, but I just want to just say: hey, I guess kind of int a little bit try to see if someone else understands what it is, I'm going through and kind of understand that if someone was to say, would you take my kids cancer and Me die, I would be on it into without any questions. If suicidal, it's not even the word to be using right now, because it's kind of beyond that step, you know it's kind of like you, feel it and you're waiting for the next trigger, and it's going to just destroy me. It'S going to destroy me. So this video channel that I just started, maybe the end of you - know just a few short videos of what my last you know. Feelings thoughts are, and unfortunately, they're not all that great, but here take your watch this or in the same seat that I'm sure that you'll, probably kind of understand and more than likely I'll, probably go to bed and I'll wake up a different human being. So well, sorry for throwing this out here, like that, I just thought that I'd share and you guys all have a very good night our good day, and I will talk to you guys later. Okay, hi 
38	Today'S one of those days today is one of those miserable days there. I have to force myself just stand to be here where I can't see anything positive in me. One of those days where I hate myself so much she's, not gon na, be good. 
85	Y'All know I'm not feeling too good man. I just want to tell you all about my day. You know I'm starting to feel like Kent. Now, like more and more like King, you know. No. Today we shall start on today I'll, have biology class and had a quiz, and you know I just didn't think I just know I did too well. You know you know, I'm not I'm just not doing good. In my biology class, my biology class and my I lock him in service classes like duels classes, are really really difficult, and I just cannot. I just cannot bring my grades up in those classes and it's very very difficult. You know and I'm supposed to be graduating this semester and if I don't pass these classes iein graduating nowhere. I ain't getting no better, I'm not I'm not gon na be able to get my associates degree and I'm not gon na be able to transfer to a four-year college, and you know that's my man. That'S my biggest concern right now. You know stressed out about school and then you know, on top of that, I'm stressed out about these two Asian girls. That'S not that's barely you know, but you know texting me. You know responding to my texts, but I just want get. I won't get to. You know I want to talk about everything that happened. You know in water pretty much like what happened from the beginning to the end, so you know I had biology class and you know the dominica members. Last night I remember oh no. I didn't tell y'all last night, our own, I called the Dominican girl up well, no, she I texted her and I still she wanted to study with me over the over the phone for the test for the quiz for all that we had today, and she called Me back machine. She instead of texting me back. She called me by machine called me like until, like maybe I could like of like four hours later, but I wasn't tripping over it. You know I didn't really care, so she called me back and she told me that she couldn't ask. She couldn't really seem really have time to UM study with me, because she held don't know, work that she had to do so. She called me back like 1:30. In the morning I was sleep I was gone. I could not stay up that late. She called me like 1:30. In the morning I was I was tired. I was dead tired. I couldn't. I couldn't study that late. So I just said: fuck it I'm going to bed, I'm tired, so I went to bed woke up. The next day went to school, took the test. She came to class. She sat next to me. She asked me if I, if she could sit next to me, said sure, move my stuff. She sat next to me and we was all talking to each other telling each other like how much we hated science, the science, the class you know talk. This was just basically just ranting about the class. How much we hated and stuff like that? You know you know this is this is a struggle man. The struggle is real man with this class. This class is very, very difficult and you know the Dominican go. You know she's finally, starting to you know that cool with me again. You know before I own the world's wrong her before you know now, she's acting cool with me now you know we we was actually. I actually was spending a lot of time where today, like it was me her and her and her sister. Like I remember after class, we went to the computer lab and we was in there she offered to help she offered to help me with on an assignment for another class that I had. She actually offered to help me, and you know she was helping me out, and her sister was in there with with she was in heret doing her own work. While she was hot wild. One in my class was helping me out. It was buffing that together the dominican girls sister was already in the computer lab before me and her before we got in there, so she was already in there. So I remember that the man can go. I told the man can go that I wanted to go to the library and we went to the library together and she asked her sister. She wanted to go with us, she said no, so she stayed in the computer lab. We went to the library, you know, yeah, we went to the library and I heard they was just they. Both of them was just getting. Something was doing some work and while we was in while he was in that dorm somewhere, I was talking to the Dominican. Go above I was actually talking. I was actually like opening up telling her. You know I talking to her about the Asian girl like how I was having trouble. You know with her having problems with her. You know the whole texting thing and everything you know her. Not responding to my texts and stuff, I was actually telling her about you know her and stuff.
26	But I don't even remember him being here. I woke up so drunk at 3 o'clock in the afternoon the next day and I just felt so pathetic. I was like what am I doing with my life and I just felt miserable. I was like. Why am I like this? Why do I do this? To myself? Like I am such a fuckup? I can't do anything right. Like I said I it makes me feel worse that I am. I have so much potential. I do good at school and I do good at sports. I had an amazing job and made some record to sales record and I had just thrown that all away, and I was just unlocked bottom, so I had this moment that I just didn't want to live anymore. I just didn't want to keep going and I've been having like suicidal thoughts two months before nobody was home and I I just went into some soul like I don't know how to describe it. I was just I couldn't think of anything positive. I was so low. I just wanted to kill myself. I just wanted to end this and I tried there was no wine at home, except this one bottle. It'S like. I don't know 80 percent or something I don't even know what it's called, and I took sleep title them down with that bottle, and I said on the kitchen floor because I got a knife from there and started cutting myself and I thought that was gon na. Be easy because I didn't really feel physical pain at that stain, but it just um was harder than I thought so I was like. Why isn't this working like with a huge at night and it's always started like sawing, and I was just sawing until I fell asleep from the pills. I thought that was my rock bottom, but when I woke up to my mom freaking out crying, she found me on the floor and she was just like hysterical and I [ Music ] had not thought about if it failed, but that happened, and that was heartbreaking To see my mom there [ Music ] and they made me throw up, then I was just watched 24/7. My best friend came over and took me to the hospital, and I was just my eyes were so swollen from crying and I was just a mess and I got a few interviews and then the mental doctor came. He took me to a mental Center. I stayed there for three days talking to therapists and doctors and nurses, and I was watched 24/7 that really got to the root of the problem and that helped me a lot. I got some answers. I took like a lot of tests for mental health and it was just a lot of depression and anxiety and, of course, alcoholism. So the first thing I had to do was go to rehab to them see how bad my anxiety and depression is because alcohol numbs you I had to get alcohol out of the whole picture to them see I was theme and how serious my depression and anxiety And so that's what's happening now my mom and dad were going to America to visit my sister and they decided to take me with them because they didn't want to leave me alone now, I'm back, we were in America for a week. Tomorrow is a day. I have to call and let them know that I'm back and go to rehab and I am kind of nervous. I don't know how it all works and I never thought I would be in this position because I don't know, there's nothing wrong with my life. I have a very supportive and a good family and good friends and we're not poor, there's nothing wrong with you. So that's what people think all the time that something has to happen for people like me. I guess like something has to be wrong or something has to happen or you go through some trauma or something to end up like me, but it's just mental disease, really there's nothing. You can do about it like I'm certain.
73	Hi everyone um, I just I don't even know what to say my phone's going off. Yes, I'm so done with life, and everything like everybody in my life has hurt me and honestly right now, I'm just like I used to wish for an afterlife to see my mom again, but I don't even want that anymore. I just want everything to stop. I'M done with the pain that I feel like life isn't worth living when all I feel is pain. I just I'm so done with everything I mean it's, not even the fact of what actually happened. It'S just it's. It happens all the time with everyone and I'm tired of being played with and I'm tired of feeling like shit like I'm nobody important like like honestly, I can die right now and the only people that actually care would get over it like it tears all over. My face, I just I don't think life is worth living anymore. I mean, I guess I should try to get some sleep clear my mind, but when I sleep I just don't ever want to wake up. I don't want to go through this ever again. I just wanted all the end: hey, I don't want this life me people and I know nobody really cares on here. So I'm not really really worried about you guys. I mean we're not there. I reckon I'm not going suicide, but I guess I'd be a hypocrite. If I said that, since I mean I've tried, I'm thinking about it now, I just I don't know what to do in life anymore. I guess I guess. That'S all I really matter seriously. I doubt I'm gon na pass at anything anyway, because my whole life is just screwed up. I know what I wanted out of it. I wanted to build homes for almost people. I wanted to give foster kids home. I wanted to make a good school, so they could learn things that actually matter. I wanted to build. My own dream house have my own children and love them. You know when I guess everything just to our dashboard. It'S like nothing's worth anything anymore.

8	Hey what's up guys and girls, my name is Danielle and welcome to my youtube channel and this title is kind of based, on my view really of this realization. Yesterday, from Hawaii and baby wood was a experience trip so the last couple of days I've been really depressed and just felt horrible and not powerless about doing you know doing my goals and you know there's breast since years, so I decided to go on this trip Because you know I know what this is do, so I felt like getting myself out of this state and you know what took like 12 seats. I cut off the outside part of it. I crushed it up, put the powder in lemon juice, extracted it in an hour or something i filtered it then I drank it and you know I expected this trip to to make me super conscious and get me some confidence, and you know stuff needs to be Stronger and bigger than the feelings coming off my from like a subconscious, because this is what I experienced that I do and when I landed trip kicked in. I kind of experience. Instead of this, I experienced just absolutely hate anger, and you know frustration and this realization that my life is shit, just disculpa little doll enjoy and and - and I felt like I just want to live - leave things behind everything. The way I do things because it just gave me frustration, I just do things badly and I really need to change because I'd only enjoy my life. Even if I kind of bushes myself that you know I do and I'm you know improving myself and going in the good direction, I don't so just some things are things that I hate in my life. Well, okay, the good thing is I'm healthy. I can only one hundred years and I had the potential to change. I had friends calling I have family, I do have love, so my life is not bad at all, but the way I live it and this emotional or habitual hamster wheel, is just really frustrating and and then just stuck in this habit in my head and can't Get out of it and the more I frustratedly try to improve myself and do things right. The washes gets so one very bad thing is that you know I'm depressed since years because of personal conflict with a girl for another country that I met, and I felt if she can wrong with me and I still miss her. But I gave her a lot of hate for wrong in me and actually never wants to see me again, which makes me feel sad. But at the same time I hate her because I can't forgive - and this kind of made me depressed - and this part is very logical - and you know you're expected to get over things. And while just talking my head for in a very long time, because I do I'm more interested in doing my own stuff instead of obeying having a job like a lot of times at home, which obviously an easy way of being depressed now, I want to do This YouTube stuff - and you know like being depressed, it will get you that gets you in this hamster wheel of bad habit, self-medicating with something having a bad sleep, damn depressed again trying to make wheel, then it's just not that good on make one video than anyone. I didn't have a success on YouTube, which makes me frustrated and makes me depressed again, and I just you know, hate the whole thing. Waking up procrastinating a lot of times. I stopped cleaning and watching YouTube videos or wasting time on the Internet meaningless, stuff waste time. On my phone, then I you know, I can't bullshit myself that I try to improve my life. Then I end up doing nothing and I don't even take time to rest. You know meet friends, so it's just the whole thing is absolute garbage and it doesn't work at all.
6	So tired of the person - I am so here's the deal. First of all, I'm wearing my hat. Most people, don't like my hat cuz they say, makes me look like a dude, but you know what I'll just put on makeup later: okay geez! So I am about to go to take care of someone's dog with my mom, so I'm not going to film because I plan on not ever filming my parents to give them their privacy. Oh yeah, I'll, be back, stay warm and toasty. What kinda looks like a bomb hot, so it appropriate? I'M just gon na be real, quick with you guys, I'm feeling pretty pretty horrible right now, no, I'm not suicidal, so no one needs to freak out. Even if anyone were to freak out. I don't know if you guys, would I'm really just at a mindset where I just don't want to be here right now that doesn't necessarily mean I'm suicidal okay, I don't like stuff right now. I can't find happiness very easily. I can in this guy. So that's! Okay, hello: this is not nice. Can you say hello, mister yeah, he's about the only happiness I could find and stuff. I didn't want to record this at first, because I've gotten a lot of crap before from people just saying that crying it. You know this is weak and that I do it too much and I'm so tired of being like this. It'S so tired of the person I am problem is I don't I'm not gon na kill myself, but I think about it all the time. This is really embarrassing that this is the second like daily vlog that doing and I'm already crying. I just wanted to show people that, like the realness behind depression and anxiety and just how much that it sucks and how much it just takes up your life greetings. So the mood has definitely changed since my last little clip I kind of just didn't vlog for a little bit because right after the last thing, I just talked to you guys about. I went to therapy and I had a really really really nice talk about everything that I was feeling felt, really good and confident afterwards and then my I immediately went back home, so my dad and I could go see a movie and in the movie is called Captain fantastic, I think that's what it's called yeah fantastic, that should be it and it has Viggo Mortensen in it. Aka Aragorn, which we all love, and I really liked it and it just kind of opened my eyes to a lot of stuff and alright we're gon na, take our short break. Okay, sorry anyways, I'm having a little bit of camera trouble. I don't even remember where I left off honestly. Basically, I'm feeling better, I'm here at the doggies house, so that we can take it for a walk and I'm gon. Na be honest, though, I'm feeling pretty insecure about my weight at the moment, especially when I make these vlogs. I can because I have this little: u finder at the top, and it just lets me see my face and it's just not making me feel too great. But what will make me feel great. Is this cute little doggy, which you'll see in just about 20 seconds, or you know what I did it so we'll be like two seconds for you guys thank you. He says paying me of a poopy woman. Well, as long as then all over the place, but not to go for a walk, you can tell it's. The proof is I'm wearing my tennis shoes, my nice Nikes, it's late, it's the kind of dark out already, but I need to get done. I need to feel good about myself because I've just been feeling really up and down all day and I'm so sick of it feel like a hormonal pregnant woman. I might as well just tell people I'm pregnant because I gained all this weight. Is my excuse. Like Oh JJ, uh? Oh you, you look good, Oh it's because I I'm pregnant yeah who's, the father, Otten! There'S, none! No yeah! Yeah! That'S a good idea! Right! Yeah! This is more thinking yeah anyway, I'm gon na go. Do my walk all right, I'm going I'll, see you guys, smile love, you guys too, the ones I actually watch things bye. 
33	I just can't take this anymore, my school hates me people more people want more people want me dead and more people hate me more people, everyday, it's just driving me. I can't take all this hate nor this pain on me. So by tonight I want to die. I don't want to be here. This pain is just way too much for me to handle it's harder and harder for me everyday. It isn't easy. Russian is very hard. It'S hard on you, you and it's hard on people around you. I know if I'm not here, people would be more depressed, but I rather be gone than to be living in this freakin hellhole. It'S not easy at all. I just hate my life because nothing goes right, anymore. The people I want the most money just now, even though you are in depression. Sometimes it can get better and sometimes it can get worse right now, I'm at my breaking point where I'm mourning to die and morning telling myself even more than our once some people can handle it. Some people can't, and I'm I'm one of those people that can't handle it. 
65	I have to say this: video, it's not it's not gon na be a happy one, but if you are like, if you're emotionally unstable anything like that, then this could be quite triggering say: don't don't what, if this is gon na upset you, oh sorry, but I'm Gon na be honest with all my feelings when it comes to this, and I need to show everyone what is oh, it's really like, and this is why I say we couldn't the pain I mean. The only thing that's keeping me here at the moment is my son and it's so bad that I know, Minister than him. How can anyone say something, and I really want to reach out to people no, but I can't make it I don't. I don't like this and then, if they cared about me, it would upset that I'm trying so to keep it together anymore. I can't do it. It'S not like. I can go through my head. It'S much as I wish more than anything at the moment I can drink until we until you have to live with this much pain. You know, and I'm sorry you see me like this, but I promise to be honest and it is what we go through. So much to say that we wish we were dead. I really do everyone tells me that I know strongest person. They know not because I really thought wouldn't be ready. 
58	I can't do this anymore guys I mean the wolves are just so high. Oh you guys, don't see this, you don't see. You guys see me for 15 minutes a week and you think you know me, and you guys know the best parts of me in the parts of me that I want to share, but I have chronic pain as a lot of you know, I can't um.

56	Hey guys, so I'm sorry, so I have to move out of this house because my dad is going to jail for a year and six months stick and I am living with my mom. I'M sorry guys. I just thought I'd show you guys like what I'm going to say goodbye to four yeah tomorrow I have to take everything out of this house. My dad did something, and now he gets to go to prison for a year and he's going to he's going to miss a lot of my legs I'll be a sophomore when he gets out and I'll be 15. I have to say goodbye to all of my animals. My friend Maddie is going to be taking my fish. I grew up here guys. I have to say goodbye to my dad this house, like cuz. I can't take them with me why I'm Billy, I'm not gon na, be making videos probably a couple years, maybe not even that, probably for a couple weeks and my dad's girlfriend broke up with him so yeah and if anyone wants to dogs to happen, I've asked Around but no cats and also a dear Chihuahua, if I can't take him, Oh 
60	I cannot deal with this. I cannot do this. I I'm just gon na give up or I'm just gon na crawl into my cave or I'm just gon na sit in this foggy haze forever and told something happens. So that is very, very possibly the defining factor of the issue that actually contributes, and primarily to that experience of feeling overwhelmed. That emotional aspect, that we keep attaching to these things, the emotional approach that we have to the issues, the the problems, the challenges and the tasks that we are faced with so solution is quite simple: drop those emotional experiences, meaning that, okay, why are they being triggered? Why am I feeling powerless? Why am i feeling helpless? Why am i feeling anxious? Why am i responding in this way when I can see that it's not effective? It'S not supportive, rather than just keeping it practical, just dealing with things as they come and looking at my responsibilities in a more objective way, so go through that process of investigation of all of these emotional attachments that have crept in to this thing. That has now become feeling so overwhelming feeling so overwhelmed, but in conjunction with that, what is important and what is really more part of the living solution is whenever we get to that point of feeling overwhelmed or feeling I can't deal with us all. Those little thoughts start creeping in. Why is no one helping me or I couldn't possibly do all of this, I'm all alone. I can't and then feeling depressed or feeling, angry or feeling anxious or little thoughts like I shouldn't even be doing all these things anyway. You know it's not even my problem. Why am I making this my problem? Things like that that start creeping in those are the points where we need to immediately apply correction, where we need to practice that self-awareness of okay, I'm having this thought - and I know where the sport leads. I know this particular thought is going to take me eventually to that experience of feeling overwhelmed, so I'm gon na stop this thought. Now I'm going to change how I'm looking at this situation, how I'm approaching this situation, I'm going to change how I'm dealing with it within myself, so that this experience or feeling overwhelmed doesn't build and build and build and get to that point of explosion or implosion. So, for example, my point of practicing correction is in these moments, where I feel overwhelmed: [ Music ], I'm going to rather make it to-do list, prioritize the to-do list and start working through each point step by step and not let myself stay in that hazy. Experience where I become less effective, because what that does is actually then accumulates onto the experience of feeling overwhelmed, because I'm not getting the things done that I need to get done at least not in the way that I know I'm capable of so I I need To be strict with myself about going into that haze, and I need to be strict with myself about practicing a more effective way to deal with my responsibilities. Yes, maybe some of them I might need to put aside for now in terms of maybe they I just literally cannot get to everything. I need to consider that, so those are all of the practical considerations that I need to me Joey. What are you doing? He'S back, okay, I'm gon na in the video now before this gets ugly. All right, if you have any questions comments or I he just turned my computer on or you'd like to me - to expand on anything or anything like that. Please let me know you can see in the dark message or leave a comment.

20	Hey guys, it's February, 8th 2016, I'm still in a pretty bad place, I'm starting to wake up and think of suicide. Every morning, I think about about jumping off a bridge. Are you using pills to kill myself? I can't I can't do this anymore. This is destroying me, I I don't even feel like I'm living. It'S just. I feel like my family's given up on me. I feel alone. It feels like the only thing I can do is be on the computer for about 20 minutes. I'M gon na stop searching for explanations. I don't know anyone who's been through this. I don't know anyone who's come back from from four months of this I mean what's left of me, even if I get it together, I can't stop thinking of suicide. I can't stop worrying. I can't stop comparing myself to other people, I'm saying everything that I don't have. I desperately need someone in my life. I can't I can't make that happen, because I I can't even get out of bed. I remember in October when this first happened when I, when I just lost my mind, I was so confused and so scared that I asked my family for help. They said I need help. I don't know what's going on. I don't know how to to make this. Stop or how to get better, they told me what what do you want us to do? What do you expect us to do, and they were angry that I had. I had asked something like that. No, I I didn't know what to do, and so I I was some kind of failure. I tried to explain to them. I just need help, I don't know what's going on, I don't know how to get better and it just looked at me and shrug their shoulders said. Well, we can't help you and you know how many visits I've gotten from my sister, how many phone calls to ask if I'm okay done any kind of support, an understanding that I can't do this alone, none! I can't get better because I have no support system. I have no one that believes in me. I just get worse and worse and worse, I keep giving me medications and they don't seem to do anything. They just make me tired and just make me out of it, and I just stay in bed all day next to a space heater in a dark room. I don't want to do this anymore. I think a person a person should have a right to say that this is enough. I'D like to say that I'm not I'm not being held by the medication professionals, don't seem to know what to do. My family refuses to even listen to even care, I'm completely alone. Every day I go days without talking to people I go days without going outside like about days, praying for death, I think before when I was really really close to doing you know I had a fear of it. I had a fear that I I would mess up or that I was sacrificing something or that I I fear being dead. Now I don't fear any of it. I don't care anymore. I don't care what my family has to find. I don't care about the pain they would be in cuz. They left me in pain, they'll, all hug, each other and forgive each other and ask Oh what what could we have done? I prayed I prayed for the help of my family. I begged for the help of my family, I begged for some kind of support, some kind of feeling that there were someone there cared. I would have helped my own family and what did time all I could, but instead I'm the one who needed help. My mom died in the same room in 2013. She died about five feet from where I'm laying. I wonder, I wonder sometimes if I could be with her if this ends. If, if I can at least be with my mom, I pray for it, I pray she'd. Forgive me that she'd understand that the family that's left here is not it's not compassionate thought. They left me on my own. They gave up on me. That'S all I'm ready to give up it. Just comes a time when a person can't do this anymore when they need peace. I need peace. I need not to be destroyed mentally anymore. Sorry, my videos got so dark. I pray that no one else has to go through this, but no one else ever has to feel feel how low this is. I pray that, for you, people out there I've run out of hope. 
61	Everybody just crying man, and I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is me being around them around everybody else. I'M just like. I said I'm just numb, I'm just numb being around everybody else. I know I'm just know as soon as I get by myself soon as I get back in my car to drive home. I think I just I'm just fucking bawling and I'm crying my fucking eyes out and I get back in my bed and I'm crying, but when I get around other people I just it's like, I can't do it fuck, even if I wanted to do it. This is, I mean it's funerals and on Tuesday, so I'm probably are you know, I'm gon na get overwhelmed and probably break down again. It'S like brown. Even this whole I've been ignoring everybody. I appreciate everybody for hitting me up and I read all the comments. Everybody who didn't me man, I got so many messages and all these cause - and I haven't heard, but I haven't responded to anybody people worried about me right. I had I've had friend as a died. I'Ve had teammates that died by do actual friends that freaking dice. I mean this is different. Of course. It'S different, I mean it's my brother, but it's just it's just different. That shit is different and as much as I as much as I just want to give up on everything give up on my life, give up on YouTube. Just I just wan na say fuck it I know. I know he won't want that shit. I know he. I know he's looking at me right now, like Russ, I what the fuck he don't call me. Sorry called me boogie boogie. What are you talking about saying you sound stupid? That'S what he's saying right now like boogie, what are you saying saying like you gon na fucking, you got just quit me good. I fucking want them. I was my homeboys in the room and he's you're. Just talking he's just like out he's just telling you like man, I don't understand why you got it so hard. You like what is it difficult? What'S different about you compared everybody else like why why all this shit happen to you and I'm like bruh, I don't know I accessing like. Why is this? Why did shit happen to me? If I was happen to our family, I wouldn't what the fuck did. We do to deserve this shit. Niggas old everything happens for a reason I just just based off the shit that already be happening already happened to me, because I already feel sorry for me. People i already was looking at me like dan upside, got a lot and then got a lot going on son being homeless and shit like my nigga side, and he just feel sorry for me. In that whole time, the guy i was feeling sorry for my brother. Just like man, i hope you get that shit right, son like when he got locked up man. I remember driving an hour to go, see him in jail and a good looking at him through the glass, and he just would have wouldn't a scar on his face and i'm just looking at him. I can't even he couldn't look at me. I couldn't look at him, I wonder where he got out man and he was on my couch on Batman. I hope that's that's when I wasn't homeless. No more - and I should say my man - I hope he hit it up man. I hope he could get back right. You saying the niggas call was calling me I'm thinking like yo man. He done got locked up again. That'S what I'm thinking you ain't got locked up again. I wish he got fuckin locked up.
25	You know what I mean like I, don't I'm not a positive person. I don't like people, I don't like the world, you know. Sometimes I really wish I just died. You know I never really honestly felt like I'm gon na. I don't feel like. I don't want to make it to 40 anyway, not with my life, not the way I stressed and unhappy as I being sometimes dealing with people shit man. I cannot see any way possible. Did I get the 40? I don't know if I'd be here number 10 years. I really don't think Jayla 47 would be on this earth in ten years. Ten years from now I just my personal opinion. I don't, I don't feel like it. I don't see it, I don't imagine it and, to be honest, I don't want. I really don't care. If I died a day, it would honestly it'd be the best thing that could've ever because I'm just I'm just fed up with people. I don't like people, you know they, they just liars, they're, just the seat, the seat fool they they not. I think this honest, you know I just and for me it just thing like I just had like a bad luck. Charm, you know what I mean. It'S like I try to do good in this world, and all I ever get back in return is bad back back back. You know it was like. Can you get a job Jay? That'S gon na work for you a job where you want to make the money that you want to make a job where you want to be comfortable at that. You were like where you have good coworkers. No can't get that all you're gon na be able to be able to go back and finish college, my situation and my living arrangements, and things like that. Stops me from doing that, and you know what I mean me money to go to college. You know I mean every time I try to get some type of help, as always the type of burden on the court. So that's not the book right now and I need money. I don't got time for college. You know I mean it'd be hard for me to do that. Anyway, you know and then it's like what about your depression. You know what I mean, I'm still going through, that I don't know they might know, but I'm mentally though I have major depression, I mean so you're not trying to take medicine for that, but that just seemed like that. Just gets worse. My depression is not improving at all like ever since my father died and my grandmom died just like it's just been getting worse and worse and worse, you feel me. So that's not improving. You know relationships. You try to. You know get in relationships for people, but people buddy, don't want that. You know they don't know how to be honest. You know, I mean you give you all and they only they only give you 25 %, but you give a hundred percent. You know it's. Just all around the board - man, I'm just this unhappy, but a lot of things that go on man, I'm just fully. I don't like this world, I don't like this world, I don't like people, you know I mean it seemed like life is just so fucked up and unfair. It'S like good people. Like me, we got ta suffer, you know, we don't have happiness, we don't have mom and I'm not saying I'm not happy like I'm the worst person in the world like as bad as I can be, but I'm just not I'm mad because I'm not where I Thought I would be at 27, I thought I would be much further know what I am. I'M not you know and you look around. You see all these evil motherfuckers and people who are not good people. They just moving up in life and you just add a stance, though you know what I mean, and they just first raise me man. You know I had thought about suicide like two weeks ago. I think, like my friendship, he was keeping a room when I was. I had a real bad day and I was just like: what's the point man like, what's the point of living his life like I, I was like fuck, this shit man. I might just kill myself, you know I mean I was really thinking about some. That'S the first time in a while. I actually thought like that. I just really was just like. Like was my purpose here. You know saying like I can't work at the type of job that I would like to work at, and you know I can't find the type of relationship that I want. You know for the person that I want to be in a relationship with you know. I'M not where I want to be financially, you know, I'm not in the city I want to be in. You know everything nothing's going my way, just nothing. You know saying so and then my family issues, I'm not really on great terms with my family. So my thing is just like: what's the fucking point, you know I mean my nigga like like. What'S the point in and living you know, I mean, like you just bet all day. If I'm saying like that's the way, I feel sometimes that's way. I feel if you ain't gon na, be happy than wanted and I mean like who didn't wait for happiness, but I got time for that. Nobody trying to wait for happiness. Nobody got time to you know I mean it's been a long time. You know I mean, since I've been really really happy, you know, since fucking 2000-2001 am I gon na tell them to wait. No, no 13! More years. You know I mean, but I might be happy I'll. Be 40 years old doesn't want to wait waiting to be 40 to need to be happy. You found sad now I don't even see myself getting 40. You know not the way I be stressed out. Man is like you just can't trust people, man, people just manipulators and liars and deceitful, and just you know I saw some diet or be loved on YouTube, even soccer issues, so I said fuck it.
42	Anthony please just let me come out. Oh just let me go back, I can't be here anymore. I don't want to block you. I want to block your anymore. How am I think it'd, be you won't come back? Fine remember: what's going to happen, is your own fault? It'S your own mistake. You caused what's going to happen, so we something I've noticed about life life in general. Is we are born just to die? We live to die death. Death is inevitable. You know it. Everybody dies but you're born just hated the second you are born. You are dying everyone watching this video you're dying right now, I'm dying right now, that's inevitable! You can't escape death, you can only prolong it, but for others, or for some that comes late in for others. F comes early in the fact of that fact that it's come to way. It'S going to come down to you the fact that life, it's gotten so dark for it. The fact they're talking is a heedful. I feel it has to you magnified the fact that has come to the point. So after kill myself and then turn kill him. I don't want him to die, but if you think I know he deserves it, I deserve it. This life is a hard life to live. This place is a hopeful place to live in everybody. Who'S subscribed to the channel to all these friends and family into my own, even though I don't think making heartless to everybody. I apologize for what you're gon na have to watch, but Anthony brought this on himself. I'M sorry! That'S fine! So the point that's gotten to you, but when I've had enough I've had enough - and I don't want to be anymore - and he hope was headed me out. This doesn't do anything. I'M sorry for this. I truly from the bottom of my heart. I'M sorry! This is the darkness that I had to scape. I cannot escape while living so Anthony, giving you one last chance, one final chance to come back. What is no escape for either of us. I mean you except they come back. You wanted an escape, you got it, but now I want to escape and I can't get it so I'll force an escape. Just like you forced an escape the references you created an escape and I'm going to destroy the escape so Anthony. You have one final chance to come out. Why are you gon na make me do this fuck, you fuck you, you making me have to do this. I didn't want to come to this. I didn't want to have to die. To escape, you forced my hand. You forced it I'm sorry they already who has two witnesses and who has to live with this decision with my decision. I'M sorry don't think this is the coward's way out. This is the hardest decision. I'Ve ever had to make remember. Death is inevitable. [ Music, ] [, Music, ], [ Applause, ], [, Music, ], 
48	This is probably the ugliest you're ever going to see me like, because I haven't looked this bad a long time and the reason why looks like bad is because I probably been crying non-stop for the past three days. I'M sorry, I need blue. This is running so probably wondering why I look like a troll. I don't even know what's going on. I don't want to put on clothes understand this. I don't care what I look like, because I just need to get this off my chest. This is the worst time of my entire life. There'S no feeling worse than what I'm feeling and I don't know what's gon na happen, because, as I'm recording this, I don't know what's going on in my relationship, we're supposed to have broken up, but no I I'm not. I don't know I feel like. I can still do thing. I can't solve egde this and I'm trying so hard because it's my entire life - and I hate everything except this. I don't want to talk to anyone right now. So that's why I'm talking to this camera because it can't talk back, because I don't want people to talk back to me because I hate people giving me advice, because it makes me feel worse when people say shit to be like. Oh, maybe it's for the best Blabberize like shut up. I don't want doing that. What I want to hear it's, that everything is going to be okay and I'm going to be fine, because I don't feel fine. I don't think it's gon na be okay, and I don't know what more I could do, because if this is over then so it's my life, there's nothing. What I want to do right now and just die. I know that's horrible, but if you knew how I felt right now, when you're alone and you're crying and there's no one here to comfort you, we could see just laughs. He did comfort me, but I don't know how it feels anymore and I've said everything. But I just I just can't I just couldn't do it because life is this bad now I can't stop thinking about everything this. No, I I'm sorry. This is such a mess. I'M trying to get both words out, but it's hard because, okay, I'm sorry about that. I just pulled out my nose piercing like a fucking idiot, because I was wiping my nose and I accidentally ripped it out for the second time. That'S happened. That'S happened to me before um. I was sorry yeah um. I just wanted this to be over or I can wish I could just and do right now, so I don't have to feel like this anymore, so I don't have to go through any pain. He'S already been in constant pain for three days, and my anxiety is just the highest that can they ever be so much so that it it fuck's up my digestive system. Well, it already have a digestive problem and anxiety makes it like really worse it, because the stress on your in like and gastrointestinal tract or whatever it is like it just just fucks it up had always seemed stress and anxiety whatever like it's all that, and I'm Surprised I haven't had a panic attack. I'Ve almost nearly had a few panic attacks, but my body's doesn't sus ago saying I guess, but you know I get like a choking feeling and my hair's, like really bothering me, I get like a choking feeling and just my stomach just just in constant pain and My mind can't stop cycling, negative thoughts, and this is my absolute worst that you ever see me at so feel privileged that are you enjoying either side me cuz? I don't want to put like my personal life out here. I just don't know what else to do right now. Can you shut up? I don't know what else to do, because I don't want to talk to anyone because nothing anyone says right. Now it's going to change anything. It'S not going to help me! It'S not gon na make me feel better and it's anything it will just be. I'M sorry, it doesn't make me feel worse. I need more tissue. Yeah it'll just make me feel worse to talk to anyone right now, the only one person I want to talk to his him, and I can't talk to him until he's back. So I'm just sitting here right now talking to the camera, because it's a way to get my emotions out rather than just talking to a wall.
22	Hey guys, I'm and here I'm just making this video, you know like just kind of documenting. I am just not doing very well and I'm just tired. You know exhausted and just out I'm like running out of steam. I guess I don't know. I just really hate my life right now. I hate just it's like everywhere. I go where I live. You know so doctors like just whatever I don't know it just seems like everything is just everything I do or go or whatever just turns to crap. I just feel so overwhelmed and just I'm just kind of starting to. I honestly think I'm started like I'm starting to so see a lot more because, like I don't know what it is, I feel like I'm not there or what almost like you know when you get put under it like you're there and then the next thing. You know you're waking up, that's kind of like how I've been feeling lately. It'S just I kind of lose time and I think, but I was having such a hard time coping, that my brain is trying to help me not think about all the bad things that have been happening. I wish I wish I could give him the help. Let my son know it. I could find somebody who's not gon na and dismiss him because of his behavior. I think I tell what is what it's like and I need help, but no one will help me. I can't find anyone or so far I don't know what to say about that. I just 
39	For my friends who doesn't understand Turkish, this is a suicide note. Sorry, I just wanted to thank you all for being in my life, bringing joy and inspiration to my life and being as awesome as you. You are all of you. I love you all, not all 
51	[, Music ], I'm just dumb. I'M tired of feeling this way, I'm tired of taking fucking medications. Everyone, even oh, no further back, there's something wrong with me. What'S wrong, is I survived? I fucking survived. I don't know why I kind of just died in the damn hospital, but it was so much easier than anything to deal with this much easier. You understand understand I'm trying to be happy in front of my voice. Yes, so he's okay like try to tell Maureen [ Music ]. What do you think babies can't do this fucked up? Like me, [ Music, ], [, Music, ], we're gon na be hated by people, because no one wants to help me. Don'T he be 
30	You know some people will never understand what it's like to be at your breaking point, a point where you feel the only way for you to escape this insufferable pain is ceasing to exist, [, Music, ]. Some people can't believe to the some people have their religious beliefs in booze, and they can't see outside of that. I was against suicide at one time. Believe it or not, you know people never want to die. They just can't find a solution to the pain and they want to escape sometime people feel like they've, exhausted all of their options, and I think that a lot of times in life, we want to believe that there is a solution to every situation, a fairy tale Story and ending, but the fact of the matter is some things are incorrigible. Every situation. You cannot repair every situation and thing is not fixable [, Music ] and I think once people are able to understand that first they will begin to see while suicide is a option for certain people. Well but at least begin to understand the state of mind that individuals are in when they consider such things. It bothers me. Sometimes people say they can't relate to other people with shoes and some situations. You know I don't want to generalize here and make general statements, because some of this is circumstantial, but some situations really are not hard to understand and I don't think that you have to be in those situations to be able to understand the level of pain that A person is in dori example, some people ignorantly tell me J. I don't understand what it's like to have very severe anxiety. You know you can't expect me to understand. I can't believe it. I don't. Have it bullshit. Everybody has anxiety at some point in time in their life. The only thing that separates my anxiety from yours is that I have a disorder. He mental illness, which means that my anxiety occurs more frequently, it's more intense and it occurs in situations in which it shouldn't occur. That'S what makes it a disorder where you guys have normal anxiety. You may experience anxiety when you're preparing for tests and college are really important to us. That'S gon na help to you know help you earn your degree, but if your doctor called you in and told you that they had who are running MRI because they feel it may be some something cancerous in your breasts or tell you that you may have a Fatal disease - and you have to come in to the doctor's office to receive the results wherever your mother father were loved. One was in a severe accident and an emergency-room notified you of this and told you that they're in critical condition and may die the level of devastation.
62	I'M still alive shoot and a lot of people don't understand what suicide is. People don't understand what it's like to be a suicidal um one day, and so many things could cause you to be suicidal um, most of the time it's loneliness. As far as someone who's been dating - and you know it's been proven - women's standards are so high nowadays and they have no standards for themselves. So it's so hard for men to find a woman that the suicide. When you look at um what caused the suicides you'll see lots of times in men, it's because there's no good women out there and the men. Men need a woman, and women are just so mean, and just badmouth men, all the time and emotionally destroy men. Men can't take the pain and that's what suicide is about. It'S about no matter whether it's that or something else it is about stopping the pain people think it's about making people feel sorry for you and I've heard people talk about suicide, like oh, I'm, too strong for suicide. How stupid that person would be to kill themselves like? Oh I'm, gon na, kill myself and make everyone make everyone else feel bad for what they've done to me in Beaubourg love is listening, this guy, not just laughing. I was like wow, you are so stupid for thinking that that's what suicide is about. It'S about stopping the pain, it's about not being able to take it anymore, and it just becomes too much and for a lot of you, people that are suicidal. You could be in a room with a lot of other people that are suicidal and all actually understand the same feeling that you're all going through, but still be alone and still feel alone. Now, in my case, besides the loneliness and knowing that I'll be alone for the rest of my life, it's also also a chemical disorder and that's what I just have to deal with and people it's so funny. When people hear you're suicidal, they think that you're gon na hurt other people, and I kind of laugh at that's like well, actually, the exact opposite. I want to help people, they don't accept my help and I think, what's the point of being around anymore. If people will not change for the better and not help themselves, do not learn. People are so stubborn in their ways and they try and prove what they want to believe. Instead of trying to find facts and believe the facts and that's where it comes from for me, but there's so many different reasons. I I know people oh gosh. I keep myself together. I know people who've lost absolutely everything. I got my very best friend since I've had oh well, not best for anymore uh, but he's still good friend close friend since I was 19 and I lived with this gentleman for a while and he lost his kids and he lost his house. He lost his business, he lost his business, he lost everything and I was going to court at the time and I almost got about 20 years and then his brother came in and lived with us and what you had. You had a big, huge, beautiful house, with a big pool in the backyard and a waterfall and a jacuzzi and the most expensive toys. The guy was a millionaire you, you had a bachelor pad with three guys and we were all suicidal and we only had each other and the only thing that kept us from doing anything to ourselves was knowing that the other two would have to live with. That and the suicide is a selfish act, yes, but believe it or not people around you. If you were to do such a thing, you will put such a toll on for the rest of their lives. I was about to finally do it and actually this isn't stuff right here I went out to get these pills and now all the pharmacies were closed and and for some reason, with my phone when I sitting and something on the phone, I would I could look Up the pharmacy to make sure they're open hit the call button and it would not detect my finger and then I would call someone else and it would call but no matter what pharmacy. It was. All the pharmacies, as soon as I hit touch, call all of a sudden. It no longer detected my finger and I dealt with it for about two hours and I called every single number that night, except the pharmacies numbers and then at the at the end of the night. I realized it was my best friend's birthday and I realized, if I had done it for the rest of my life. My best friend would remember on his birthday. This is the day that my best friend Justin killed himself and I would have ruined that. For the rest of his life - and you see, there's people out there who you don't know this, but if you were to kill yourself, there are people out there who will blame themselves and maybe people you don't even know very well.
68	Hey guys, we are not perfect at all, like not even close. You know. Like the other day, I was saying how there are still sins in my life that haven't been revealed and um, but you know he'll be revealed later well, God just revealed in me how I lack self-control. It'S funny cos a control freak. I lack self-control and he allows us to get to a point where we need him like so much that it forces us to to admit you know how helpless we are, how weak we are, and that just happened. That'S where we should be. That'S true, repentance! That'S where you're like acknowledging the truth of your depravity and how you cannot save yourself and then you turn to God for salvation. That is true repentance. That is the place where you appreciate Jesus the most and you just fall to your knees, cuz you're, so grateful because you realize how screwed you'd be without him. Basically and that's what he taught when he came here. You know he was like you guys, think you keep the Ten Commandments, but you don't because if you even look at somebody with lust you've already committed adultery and if you hate your brother you've already murdered him. He revealed the depth of our depravity. He showed us how we fail, and that was the whole point of the law and there's a scripture about it. It says that the law is a schoolmaster to point us to Christ and that's exactly what it was. It shows us how we fail. It shows us that we need a Savior and then he died for us and they realized why, but even before he died for them. They were like man who can be saved. Then, if the law is that hard - and he said with men, this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. He wasn't talking about us being perfect in our flesh. He was talking about our spirits being perfected, but by his blood being shed on the cross. We received his perfect righteousness by faith when we put our trust in him. Thank God, we can put our trust in him, because otherwise we would have no chance because once and can separate you from God, falling into sin is bad, but there is good in it because you realize that you need jeans is Oliver again, and God always brings Good from the bad, he always turns a bad situation into something good. So please keep me in your prayers. I feel like I am being tested big time right now and Kalyn are going through a lot of changes and a lot of tests and we need your prayers. So I love you guys and I hope you have a blessed day. Lord part of us [, Music, ] 
52	I don't let it keep saying. No, my videos, I'm gon na, go back to regular content or not regular Khan did because they don't have for clear content in my channel, but you know like recording all the things that I want to record for this channel. Sharing. All the stuff that I wanted to do on this channel - and I never do - I just want to talk about it a little bit because I lost motivation concepts though it's not something that just happened this year, but last year as well. Sorry, I'm losing motivation in reading and just watching TV shows which sounds weird and it's not because I don't like it it's just cuz. I prefer to waste my time to everything. Basically, why do I have to do anything right now? I want to believe that I can do you too. It'S one of the biggest dreams in mind like I'm, not explaining it. Just it's like something that I wish I had hoped for, because I had hope for it in the past notes: it's terrible filming! It'S one of my passions. You know music music is my music is one of my biggest passions and then I just love music. A lot - and I wish I wish I could do music for a living. I wish I could or how to sing, because I don't know how to sing for just learn how to play the guitar properly or the drums and [ Music ] motivation, I'm so passionate about music. I still want to give miss a hope that there's something I can do about it. You know, but there is some feels terrible. I cried a lot during the past month. Nothing seems right anymore. My existence, I'm sort of floating around houses. I don't want to go back to my country either it's terrible over there. I feel like I can be myself. I don't have goals over there, but I don't have goals here either. So, what's the one you're going on with life, you know I was in the hospital. You know that I'm not planning on going back in there and that's sort of what scares me and what keeps me away of trying to do something, because when I tried to do something again, people were smarter than me and they stopped me. They managed to stop me, and that was not fun. You know, but I convinced them that I was gon na. Be okay and I mean I'm not okay, I'm just alive I'm alive in the outside, like a dead body that needs to be carrying around me hope. I almost every day and pain is just too strong because I lost the people that I care about the most because of my own fault. I want to believe that I could do stuff for myself. I can hold myself, I'm not gon na close, my channel, of course I'm not stop the living. I think that I want to say is that it's gon na hurt 
47	Hey guys to Raymond, this is my first video and today I wanted to talk to you about life and why I think it's pointless, but first I want to tell you a little bit about myself. I'M 17 years old, I'm bisexual, I'm into like metal, music and rock and stuff like that. Some days, I, like include arch-enemy, As I Lay Dying Bullet For My Valentine disturbed Five Finger: Death Punch, Slipknot, Avenged, Sevenfold Suicide, Silence, the old Linkin Park, nothing new Linkin Park. The only new Lincoln Park, album I like is the hunting party and yeah. So I wanted to talk about why I think life is pointless and why I don't think life is worth living well hold on. What was I gon na say? Oh yeah, um fuck it again. Oh yeah, I feel like everybody's life is the same because like well. First off, I think it feels like life revolves around like jobs and stuff like that cuz like when you're older, you have to get a job and get money to work to live and stuff, and that applies to everybody and I think, that's pointless, and I just Think everybody's life is pointless because it's all the same you you're born you grow up. You get a job, no you're born you grow up. You go to school, you get a job, you probably get married. You probably have shit. Sorry about that. I was just sitting on a container and I fell in it. Yeah just disregard that. What was I saying so you're born you grow up, you go to school, you got a job, you probably get married and you probably have kids and then you die. I mean doesn't that seem pointless like like, since it applies to everybody, and I and everybody says that the point of life is being happy and everything, but I think being happy is pointless because one minute you're happy then you're sad, then you're happy then you're. Sad then you're happy, then you're, sad and so on so forth I mean: doesn't that get annoying it's like, wouldn't you rather feel nothing at all and yeah. I just think, that's all pointless, because everybody gets a job and goes to school and everything, and it just seems pointless, I mean not. Everybody gets to be like famous or anything like it being like the bands I just mentioned before and like they don't get to become like actors easily, it's not easy being in the entertainment industry, because you have to be like really lucky to have that. But yeah. It'S just since most people have like a job at like places like shop, right, Walmart Target or a hair salon, or whatever just I have a job at shop right and I think it's kind of boring, but I mean I just started there like a couple weeks Ago so I'm just getting used to it tomorrow, I'm going to Disney World, so I won't be there for like a week or so and yeah just yeah. I just think life is pointless because everybody has to like get a job to live. I think that's bullshit, because people should do other stuff with their life. I feel like the world just revolves around money and that's stupid and pointless. So yeah just leave a comment and tell me what you think and just if tell me, if you think life is pointless or not, and if it's not tell me why you think it's not, and if it is tell me why you think it is so yeah. Bye 
75	Hey guys, I'm currently in New York for the creator summit, and I always love this event, because it's an opportunity for me to talk to a bunch of other creators that I don't normally get to talk to, and I think a common theme during this one is That we're all starting to realize that we're human. I mean it's a it's common knowledge that youtubers try to compete to see who can be the most hardworking person out there, but but I always enjoy taking the time to talk with people personally, not about YouTube, not about how how the numbers are doing. But how they're doing in their life - and like I said one of the common themes is that we all have points where our creativity breaks down a bit. We all have points so self-doubt and we all have points of just where we're feeling low in life. So I wanted to make a video to kind of convey some knowledge, because I'm actually doing I'm actually doing really well right. Now, I'm in a good place in my life, I feel I feel fulfilled creatively and I feel like I'm on the path to doing something. More and that that's owed largely in part to the fact that I'm not taking everything so seriously as I used to I'm trying to be more like myself, I'm trying to be more open about my feelings, but I also wanted to make a video that you guys Could watch if you're ever feeling, low and you're ever feeling like the world is coming down around you first and foremost, is that it is absolutely okay to feel down. It'S absolutely okay to feel sad. You don't have to put up a front of happiness. You don't have to put up a fake wall of doing fine. You can be real about your emotions, you can you can be honest with yourself and you can be honest with those around you. You don't have to worry about. Burdening those around you with your sadness. You don't have to internalize it always and number two. You have to identify what it really is. That'S causing your sadness. We'Ve had a few speakers here at the creator summit. One of them was Erik Barker, who was talking in great length about how success measures towards happiness and a lot of it. You know, isn't a competition between happiness and success. It'S it's about using those two things in conjunction with each other. Now you feeling down. Maybe the result of someone bullying you or the result of you, bullying yourself and one of those things is something that you can change and one of those things is something that you can try to change. You know others, bullying. You is a problem of the environment that you're in and the steps to be taken to change that or harder than one might think, but even harder than that are the steps to stop bullying yourself, which is the one thing that you definitely can change. But probably the one thing that we all do more than anything else so identifying if your depression or your sadness is coming from a place of internal hate, is something that plagues a lot of us and and also it's it's not something that needs to be fixed Right away, some some of us get down on ourselves. I can me myself included because we expect so much out of ourselves. You know we want to do so. Much therefore, we're upset when we do less and that's a poisonous way of thinking and it's a poisonous like a route to take yourself down, because it only means that you don't celebrate your successes enough and you only admonish your failures and that's no way to live. So, if you're, if you're ever feeling this way, just remember that you you can choose to forgive yourself for transgressions, you can choose to forgive yourself for failures. You can choose to be above your own hate and take that as an example for the hate in the world around you. A lot of bullying these days are people that are projecting their own hate on themselves upon others, so that they can escape their pain, and you know that's no way to live, but that's someone else's problems. If you're feeling down about yourself, then many times, you just need to forgive yourself, but there's also environmental factors that aren't you being mad at yourself for being upset with yourself they're their situational things, money's, not enough. You know your home life isn't solid. Here your your relationships are breaking down. You don't feel, like you have friends to surround yourselves with, and in those times I don't have an anecdotal piece of advice or words that are gon na fix your problem or even likely to make you feel better. But if it does bring you any solace, just know that I really honestly truly believe that you can get through it. I honest believe that you're strong enough to pursue your goals and to conquer your dreams and go farther than you ever thought possible, but the only way to do it is to keep trying, no matter what no matter, what gets in your way. No matter what adversity you face, if you keep trying, if you never give up, if you always pursue that thing, which makes you happier the thing that makes you burn inside you for the the ambition that you have, the projects that you see on the horizon, the Dreams that you hope to achieve, if you keep your eye on them and not just on the dream itself, because if you obsess about the dream and what it will mean when you get there, you'll ignore all of the obstacles on the path like really focus. On the whole picture of everything, if you're trying to do something and you're constantly met with failure or your friends, don't believe in you or your family doesn't believe in you, then those are obstacles that are on your path to your goal and you need to see The whole picture, you need to realize that that some dreams carry a heavy price, but if they're worth it, then nothing can stop you, and this is something that's pushed me to where I am today. That'S something that's gotten me where I am because when I started YouTube or when I started just in general wanting to take control of my life, I looked at the entire road ahead of me or, as far as I could possibly see, and I was been with More obstacles than I ever could have imagined, but what it took and what I realized right away was it took sacrifice and it took Drive and it took unyielding passion and it took sleepless nights and it took lost friends and it took fake friends, and it took My parents, not believing in me it took it, took and and after I pushed beyond that, I started to gain the recognition that I was right all along and it's it's not as simple as that, but that's what it boils down to. So if you're feeling low, are you feeling down or are you feeling like you're, not succeeding in life or you're feeling like those around you aren't supporting you just remember that I believe in you and that everyone here in the comments, believes in you and that we're All in the same boat together and we can all succeed if we just believe in each other and believe in ourselves. So anyway, I got ta get down. We'Ve got more events today. Thank you, everybody! So much for watching and as always I'll see you in the next video bye, bye, 
89	Is that traumatic to me about how to if I'm gon na tell the story all the way I have to get into details, so he started filming down there with his hands and stuff, and it's really hard like even to just get the words out. It'S like really difficult for me, so just bear with me, so he was putting his finger on a place. You'D like you, got ta kind of over me and it's hard, but I'm saying something like I am now like. I know what it feels like to be choked up, because that's exactly what I'm experiencing right now not today, not today, I'm not gon na cry. Look anyway, you got to fill in places with his hand and stuff, and he pulled my swimwear over to the side. Oh, I, like you guys, i I just feel like I'm gon na melt right now, like it's like I'm reliving the moment telling me, but I'm only going to tell this just so you guys can be aware of these types of people so um he moved my Swimwear at the bottom over to the side - and he took hits oh my god. He took his private part out or whatever got the rubbing in places and stuff, and he tried to what's his stuff in moody, too sad tries to force itself in and thankfully thank God. I was a virgin at the time he fought and pride and pride. He tried his best like he was so good since they tried to Jesus. My heart is like racing right now to try to enter into me to faith, and it just wasn't working. It wasn't fitting, thank God, and he did that for probably 15 minutes and after then I guess he kind of gave up and mind you. There was nothing I could do because I couldn't swim. I so I just had to sit there and go through it like, and then I was I was yelling, but I was more so focused on trying to get him trying to convince him to talk to him and try to convince him to take me back to Shore or you know at least where the water is an unsafe position, so in-between me yelling and calling for my sister's. I was trying to convince this man to take me back, so he tried for a whole 15 minutes and God must have been with me because it didn't go in. He tried and tried and tried in the track, and he just wouldn't go in st. God, but even though nothing went in nothing just that touching me and rubbing and kissed it and completing his finger places like I, I still consider it sexual assault like to the Fullest, so thank God he gave up after, like 15 hold minute when t minutes like literally and he started, welcome back a short me now. One thing I am glad about: instead, he didn't you just drop me cuz, I wan na definitely drown. No one could hear me, no one was right there. I would have died more than likely so lovely. He did walk me back to shore. In a moment, I got like two here with the water punch the man I kicked away from like I kicked him and kicked off against him and I ran. I don't want to say well, because I couldn't really run in water if that makes any sense, but I got away from that man as fast as I could like it's fast as I could. I also thank God that he didn't try to get aggressive back with me, because if he wanted to chase me or catch up with me, definitely couldn't have because he had longer less because he was taller but he'd be end up like actually passing me up, like. Thank God he wasn't coming after me, so he called up he kind of went as I'm moving fast. You know walking through the water, it's hard trading or walking through water, and it just felt like I was going through slow motion like it just felt like forever. So he kind of passed me up and he'd beat me to shore, because his last was much longer. He knew how to swim and he was much taller and all of that, so him in his guys. They just kind enough fast, like they were already where the blocker rooms was by the time I got out of the water like. I couldn't see them no more, they were gone, they didn't wash up in the outside shower or nothing, I'm not sure if they went into the locker rooms, because at the interesting you can't really tell so I don't really know. I just know they went around where the locker room was that so I don't know if they love me or if they went in the locker / bathroom or not. But you guys, I'm not even sure. If I told my sisters, I have to ask them, because I'm not even sure if I even told them I was just so hysterical, I didn't even called the police.  
46	I was raped by my brother's friend um. Let'S just clear this up, I wasn't technically raped technically, I wasn't raped technically, but I can save that um. Some things did happen that I didn't expect and it was hectic. This was actually around the time that I realized that I was you know introduced so he's just gon na put it like this um it had to be 2000 and 2012 or 2013. So basically, I was down to my father's house and my father. He lived in this apartment, complex where it was like apartment, complex and in the back of the apartment. You know you had to pull anything. You saw like everybody else's like partner, like bacon boat, I remember being at my father's house and him and my stepmother. My little brother, my two little brothers they were on, they had end up leaving they left. I forgot where they was going to. I think they went to my grandmother's house. She lived like around the block or they they went somewhere. I don't know I forgot, but they end up leaving and um. It was me my older stepbrother. Well, it was just me and my older brother. We were there and there, my oldest brother ended up leaving and my older stepbrother. He end up coming with a gang of his friends. It'S so sad um, I'm not saying any names. Oh yeah, my brother end up my stuff and my step older brother. He end up coming with like a gang of his friends. It was so many of them. There was girls guys it was like a gang of them, it was, it was at least like I believe it was like 11 of them. It was so many of them. I just know it was a lot and they were going to go in the pool, so they are like. You know, they came in the house, you know stripped down and they went to the pool. So my brother, he was like you know. If he wants you to come out there, so I'm like okay, so you know I went to the pool with him and you know we outside at the pool, and so you know the the boy my brother's friend he um, you know we, everybody was dumping, everybody Into the water Duncan everybody into the water, so you know I wasn't thinking too much other you know, but me I was telling them don't throw me into the water because for what I'm scared of heights? Second, I'm scared of falling from Heights and three, I just don't trust people picking me up, because I know that's a whole nother person that you're lifting like you have to be unstable, not only that we're buying water. So if you slip I'm not trying to die like you know at me, so well as I'm telling everybody like not say, like you know, throw me in a lottery like: oh, you know, you'll and whatever blah blah. So here comes my brother's friend, I'm literally like standing right there on the ledge, and he comes and just like it's just like throws me in the water I'll just sit now, I'm just like. So you know I get out the water and I'm so upset. I'M like, are you serious, and so you know I'm like I'm telling them like. I told you don't throw me in the water, like you know what I mean so now, I'm mad, and I look at that when I was younger, I used to be well. I'M still that way, I just have to address a problem, so you know me being the person I am him. I stormed out of the little pool area. I got out the water I for mine. I tried to chase him around cuz. I got so mad like I'm, trying to push him in the water, but it's just saying work so now I'm feeling barest and I feel stupid and I'm just mad because I'm like I just told you not to push him in the water. So I storm out of the little pool area and I go directly back into my father's house - climb over the little banner still biting me not going there, I'm in the bathroom dry myself off or whatever all this net, and then I go in the kitchen. I didn't ever take off my swim trunks under cuz, I'm thinking. Maybe i cool down. I get back on the water, so I go in the kitchen and I was going to go. Make me like a peanut butter, jelly sound. So then I don't make. Am i selling you know I heared a little the the patio door like open.

There were some things that were very stressful that that happened. So I can totally see that I will say in the footage that you're about to see I'm not choking, I could still breathe. Basically, what happened is like my whole neck muscles, just in my neck and in my shoulders just tightened up, I mean like this. I mean it was like a charley horse, but in my throat and in my shoulders is very very painful. It happened several times that day and I tried to vlog. I wanted to do a vlog on what I would tell my 13 year old self. I would try and I got into it a little bit and then it started and I couldn't get it to stop and it really really scared me. I was pretty upset that day and um. It took me a few days before I could watch the footage and when I did, I realized how awful it sounded and how scary it was going through that person. I wasn't going to share it with you guys at all I mean it's a horrible video. I mean there's no way I would have ever edited it edited. Who else has problems that word edited it and and put it out there as content, but I got to thinking and this experience that you and I had. I want it to be an honest one.

They'Ll come to you that was my computer, I'm having a really hard time talking. You know this. This is really scaring me and flip.

57	And, for those you that know those of you that don't, every Thursday is the day that I do my radio show. And you know, I call it a radio show. It's really like a glorified podcast. You know? I get it up on the SoundCloud and TuneIn and then it goes out 15 times on shortwave to, you know, the international audience there and this week's show... I mean, I was really feeling it! Like the last few weeks, I wasn't really feeling the best one week. I had some terrible anxiety one week. I had some bad migraines, so I was able to put something together. But, you know, it could have been a little better, but I was just inhibited by just how I was doing physically. This week I was feeling it and I said, you know what? I'm gonna work hard at this. I'm gonna get a good show out for everyone and... And you know? I did. I really put a lot of time into it. I worked for a few days. I actually made the show about an hour longer than it usually is, where I just I had a lot to talk about. Got some good music played and I was just on a roll. I got the show set up. I edited it, you know, I really wanted to promote it too. So I was trying to get the links, you know, to where it it streams on tune in and the shortwave frequencies and listening times to everyone that wrote in, you know? I was working for 8 hours straight. I was getting to about 4 or 500 emails. I was responding and I thought yeah, I mean, I'm really on a roll today. I was feeling this show I'm gonna get it out. I'm gonna get it promoted and I was exhausted by the end of it. You know, I was working through the night finally fell asleep. I woke up just in time for the first broadcast airing to, you know, start checking it out and make sure everything's going all right. And... I'm not hearing in the show! It's just it's it's dead air!! I checked the tune in stream and it's just silence! There's nothing there! I checked the short wave frequency, you know, where the radio station is supposed to be broadcasting it. There's nothing. I'm scratching my head. I'm trying to think. Oh, wait a minute, you know, I I know I sent them the file. I know I, you know, I submitted the show to them. So so what's going on? So I sent the manager of the radio station an email, you know, not not angry, we're on really good terms and I just said, you know, well, you know, What's going on? Is everything all right with the computers? You know? I just wanted to check and my my I don't see my show airing. What's uh, what's up? And... Then he broke it to me.He said listen, you know, we we kind of have a problem! Someone hacked into our computer system, deleted or I think encrypted all the files that they had every audio program and then was demanding money to get them restored. And they said, you know, Look we're dead in the water here! We can't even access any of the shows that we're supposed to air. We're not going to give in to this guy's demands! So we need to get a whole new computer system set up and unfortunately... It's not going to be finalized until maybe maybe tomorrow at the earliest. Which, in short, means that everything that I was working on and promoting and doing over the last few days for this radio show was for nothing! And It was due to circumstances outside my control, outside the control of this radio station. It was just some hacker that decided to screw with them and, you know just try to get a ransom kind of like, you know... You remember those old viruses that used to infect your computer and say it was locked by the FBI? Unless they give him like five hundred bucks? And, you know, that kind of deal same type of thing. I knew that it wasn't my fault. It wasn't the fault of the folks who work at the radio station. They were working to get it fixed. Man, I couldn't help but feel so disappointed. I was I was feeling disappointed. I was feeling down. I was feeling frustrated. I was shaking my head and I was just saying damn it, you know, I spent so much time. So much energy. I was just trying so hard to get a good show out to all these people who were looking forward to it and It's not gonna happen. Yeah, there's a few people that's still tuned in on the SoundCloud. But, I know the tens of thousands of people listen on shortwave and on TuneIn they weren't notified that this was gonna happen. No one knew that it was all gonna go down. And I was just kicking myself. I was just I was just saying, you know, total loss! Just a complete and total loss. I kept kicking myself! Like I kept I just kept beating myself up. Getting down on myself.
86	I really felt like there are people that will look past your appearance and that's order right. There are people out there who will past how you look, and we will be with you even if you're unattractive, and it doesn't even matter to what degree of unattractive you are because there will be girls that will not really care. The problem is finding them, which is the I would say that depends on the country if you're in a country with extremely lots of tourism, extremely good economy, everyone are decently rich, like everyone are decently, beautiful. All that maybe it's time to look into future plans and move to another place where you can find more unattractive people, because that's sort of what you want anyway. This girl - and I was friends a few weeks and whore - were well friends with benefits, and then we sort of broke contacts and stuff. She was one of those people that were like I get bored of people easily, so it was like yeah. So we didn't really stay friends anyway, after after that time I sort of got really annoyed of being alone and my ex wanted to come come and visit me. The girl. I was with for all those years that treated me so bad and I was so weak. So I said: okay and I spent another free or it was about four years. I'Ve spent seven in total, we first, so it was about three more years with her and those here, sorta improved quite a lot. There were a lot better than the first three years. So it wasn't that bad, but it didn't work out because I was so unhappy. I was extremely unhappy I felt like we had nothing calm and she was always angry. Moping complaining and she didn't feel good and I didn't feel good. We were just tearing each other down and I couldn't forget all all the things in the past and like we had nothing in common except just being angry on each other, so we broke up and with that was about five months ago now and I move past Everything quite easily so, one month ago, after we broke up, I started to try and date again and the bombardments of you are ugly or not. My type was so unreal. I can tell you a few things that I've been through. I'Ve met people that are extremely girls that are extremely overweight and don't look well as a well as well, and they tell me you're, not my type you're way too ugly or dim. They make up an excuse like. Oh you didn't text me the same day. I can't be free, I can't have you as a contact and they'd do anything to get rid of you and then there was this time when I had a date with a girl, and I had spent lots of money on making a perfect day together, like I Had setup everything perfectly and I went on the subway over an hour and I stood on the train on the train station and I looked for her for two hours before I was like. Okay, she gave up and then I went home and she wrote that when she saw me I was so ugly. She didn't have the encouragement to talk to me and now I made an algorithm for a site. That'S like tinder, but it's called PADO. It'S like tinder. Pretty much where I automatically love every person, no matter who it's like a special algorithm for a program that I made so that I click a button and it likes 600 people every day which was double limit, and it's I've done that for over 10 days. So that's I know easily it's over 6,000 people that I have liked on that side like like and wants to write with. No, I'm not a single one has responded, not a single one, even though I put on the best photos, I can find not a single soul wants to reply or write or give it give a person like me a chance. So where am i standing this alright? Now extremely depressed, extremely sad feeling like giving up, I have sort of given up a lot on many things and all these events, through the years have made that I haven't been able to live a normal life, because my friends were commenting on me.
55	Hey guys, so I haven't really exactly sat down here and made a video in a pretty long time. It'S been probably like 2 months since I've sat down. I made a video and today I just want to have a chat because, first of all, I miss you guys. I'Ve missed making videos and um yeah. I just want to tell you guys, you know what's been happening and the reason for why I haven't been filming. So basically, these last couple months, I just really haven't been feeling 100 % myself. You could say I just wanted to make this video, because you know there may be someone else out there, who is feeling the same way as me, and even if this doesn't help you which, hopefully it does, but if this doesn't help anyone, at least, if you Know you're not always feeling a hundred percent, then you're, definitely not alone in that so first off, I just want to say nothing like really bad has happened. Anything like that. I am totally fine and I'm definitely starting to feel a lot better. These last couple of weeks, I'm actually feeling pretty good right now and I've just been feeling you could say stuck and just like very stagnant. It just feels like I'm going nowhere and all these things that I'm trying to do in my life and all this, if it I'm trying to put in with my career and just live life in relationships and things in general, it just feels stuck and like. Nothing is working, so I guess I've just been feeling a little down. I know it will go through this, but you know, usually I have lots of video ideas and I'm really excited about filming, but more recently I've just been really struggling to find that level of motivation, but only with YouTube, but just with life itself. I guess, and sometimes you just feel like you're in an environment that isn't pushing you and you just feel a bit unmotivated and uninspired and it affects your mood and it affects you. I think that living just being alive, being a human being on this planet, is all about sharing our experiences and connecting and talking to one another so that we can help each other grow and I feel like it would be selfish of me to keep this to Myself, if that makes sense, it's really great that so many more youtubers are talking about these kind of things now and are talking about mental health and all of that, because it is so important, I'm not trying to make you feel bad for me, I'm not trying To get attention from this like this, isn't anything particularly bad, I'm not like super depressed or anything. It'S just. I just feel like I'm stuck and just a bit down, and I know everyone goes through that so just want to kind of share where I'm at and see if they can help anyone else out as well. Since I haven't been feeling like myself, I promised myself that I wouldn't make another video until I felt a hundred percent like me again like happy Danny, even though how I've been feeling isn't something super serious to be concerned about or anything, I still didn't feel right. Coming back on this channel and just making like the usual travel or comedy or whatever those types of videos that I usually do, I just felt like if I was gon na come in here, sit down with all my video and turn this camera on. I honestly I couldn't just be like hey guys, how's it going. My name is Danny and welcome back. You know because that's how generally baby, because I'm usually quite a bubbly, can an outgoing person and I get really excited about talking to you guys, but it didn't feel genuine because I haven't been feeling in that mood. So I thought that you know next week and it's gon na be fine. I'M gon na be feeling awesome again so week rolls around. I still feel stuck in the slump and I'm like I'm not filming like this another week, and now it's been a couple of months that have rolled around and I am feeling better now, but I didn't just like randomly wake up one day and be super excited And super happy and like yeah: let's go: let's film a video, I was kind of waiting and waiting to feel that way. But then I just thought: what's the point in that, because it's almost like I'm just putting on this persona and that's character, and I'd only come on to this channel when I'm just going to be this super bubbly like person that just doesn't have you know any Kind of negative emotions or feeling and um I've been kind of getting sick of just not filming anything, so I thought hey. This is me this is real and we can't always be that bubbly persona, that a lot of people do and I put on on their videos because into the day we're just real people talking to a camera. I don't say that most youtubers aren't a hundred percent. How they are in their videos in real life, all the time for sure, but I've always just wanted to be as Braille as possible on this channel that I can be otherwise. I just kind of don't see the point in doing it. If it's not going to be genuine, I feel like just shoving all of that under the rug - and you know just pretending - it's okay and coming on here and trying to be that person wasn't the right thing to do. I don't want my channel to ever.
77	I'Ve just been in such a a weird um frame of mind lately and not that I haven't been myself, but I've just had I'm a very emotional person. If you don't, if you don't believe in astrology, then you're gon na roll your eyes at this, but I am a cancer. We are very emotional always, and so you know I'm always emotional, which is recently I've just been. You know a bucket of emotions. I lost someone recently and it was a very weird loss for me. Something I'm not necessarily you know hundred percent comfortable. You know going into details, but it was just a very weird relation to that person and the loss just not only hurt because I lost someone, but it just brought back a lot of a lot of feelings. Um. A lot of really scary feelings that I haven't dealt with in a really long time. You know they come from a place where I was not happy, I'm not depressed. Now I used to be very bad, but I'm not there at all. Now I'm very happy with myself and I'm very happy with my life, but just to be back to like those thoughts and that frame of mind to be reminded of all that was just a very it's very emotionally draining um, I'm so I've been dealing with that And I've just graduated high school and um. Obviously that's stressful. I'Ve decided I'm going to college a semester late, I'm not taking a gap year, but I need to go uh semester late because I went to school. I live. If you are in Maryland, then you know what this means, if you don't live in Maryland or you're, not in the DMV area. You'Re gon na have no idea what I'm talking about you know, but I live in PG County and my score was going to was in Anne Arundel County because I got started there and it was just really important for me to finish high school where I started. It so I could graduate in the class of people that I know just because I'm a scaredy cat, I really didn't, want to go to a completely new school and meet new people, and my boyfriend is my best friend. I didn't want to not be finishing high school in the class with him. I was just afraid to be away from him and my best friend Anaya, and it was just terrifying for me, so I just um. Just I didn't do my makeup. Cuz now I'm just talking I'm not even doing makeup. It'S a 40 minute drive 40 45 minutes um, so I had to wake up super early and every morning bless her soul, she's. So supportive of me, I really do love my older sister um. She drove me to school every day, 45 minutes out from where we moved, and I you know. I always appreciate that for that and because of that I never I did that my 11th right year and my senior year, and so because of that I never really got to do driving school. I never they got through druggie school. So I now have two and I am moving out - I'm jumping I'm jumping around. I never got to do driving school and that wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that I'm moving out. So my mom, my older sister and my stepdad all Drive, and they are very helpful with getting me to where I want to be and where I need to be so that I'm grateful for, but they're not gon na. Be there to do that for me anymore, because I am moving out um, so I'm starting school, a semester late, because I have to do do driving school and I just want to get that all the way out. The way not only driving school but because I'm moving, I just need to save more, you can never save. You can never save enough. I just need to work, work, work, work and trying to get a job. Literally, since I had a job. That'S how it worked was March these March of this year, and it is June now it's the end of June now and honestly at first. I wasn't trying very hard like I was like you know, I'll fight here and there, but I've been trying to adamantly get a job honestly since about the end of May and it's now end of June, and the issue with that was because I was not 18 Places weren't going to put me on full-time and, if you needed to be, you know 18 to do a full-time or all the rid all the good jobs. 
70	It is like fucking heroin and you can't get away from it like you know. People are like, oh, but you know you can choose this. You can choose that. That is like having somebody carry around a fifth of vodka that is open or a martini all day. Long in their fucking alcoholic and that's their favorite thing in the world, sugar addiction is one of the hardest things in the world to get rid of, and I don't know how people fucking do it. And if, if there was a way that you know, I could figure it out, and I would do it on my own believe me and I feel like a constant failure. I feel like if I have a piece of candy or if I have a handful of gummy bears or if I have you know a piece of cake at a party or something like that. Or if I have this event that I'm failing myself and that that takes a toll on me because after I've had those things, those feelings and everything that I'm trying to eat down mentally and emotionally, I'm in a lot fucking pain. And I don't like to come on here and be like yes, I did this and that I'm hurt that it's awful its worst thing ever and when I wake up like I can barely move and when I'm trying to get down the stairs like I sit down And try to scoot down I'm like. I don't want to tell people that, because, even though you guys know that I had issues with my back at my hip there is that part of me where I'm like some people, have it so much worse. So what the fuck am i crying about? What is my deal? What is my issue? You know some people like are in wheelchairs. Some people have, MS, some people. Have you know Lou Gehrig's disease. Some people have shit, that's not curable, they don't need just a hip replacement, they don't need just to lose weight. These people have honest-to-god horrible diseases, and here I sit like why are you big, fucking fucking baby, and I am trying really hard not to think about the war. It'S stills my breath from my lands, I'm trying not to look at the news and try not to talk to people about it. I'M trying not to you know, ask too many fucking questions because I'll lose my shit. Have it my husband in danger and there's nothing. I can do about it and there's no way I can get to him at the moment. So when I see him on skype, I don't talk about working. He doesn't talk about that stuff with me because he doesn't want to scare me hard, but people haven't worse. So when I don't deal with shit like this, when I do the one extreme or the other, what I don't actually work hard, whatever is bothering me, I have different kind of hitting attacks where I start shaking and my hands go numb and my lips turn blue And my fingernails turn blue and I can't feel my toes and I'm just shivering as hard as I could possible until my neck and my head is like busted. It really. The only thing that makes it better is for me to go, take a hot shower and then know that I have to deal with this. I have to deal with it I have to.
1	I feel like I'm just suffering in my pain every day and it's like I don't know part of me, is it's just like fighting or resisting things avoiding things. So I live with my parents, and I can't talk to my parents because if I say I'm unhappy or miserable those be like well, obvi should have listened to us and became an accountant or you need to go to a job. Fair. Everything with them is based around like money earning a living living. I just can't talk to them about emotions at all, like, like I said before, when I was depressed in college, I told my dad. He said When I was your age. I didn't have time to be depressed and, like you know talking about how he worked 18 hours like you know, he slept like two hours at night cuz. He had two jobs in college and um. I'M not just so weird that, like that generation they were in survival mode and it's like, then, you have mmm our generation who was supposed to be like benefiting from the fruits of all their hard work. But if you don't have any like emotional support or foundation, it's like so impossible to like grow and just live and be an adult. I listened to a mental illness happy hour, podcast, which I'm plugging again. I made video about it, but he's big on group therapies and are going to group therapy, and i do want to experience what he's talking about. But like one I like a group therapy and it was like ninety dollars a week. I don't know - maybe I just haven't - found the right - the right group but ninety dollars a week like I thought, group therapy was supposed to be cheaper than individual therapy because I actually have a discounted rate. The therapist I see now. So i only pay forty nine dollars a session which i think is pretty good, so I thought group therapy should be less than that, but apparently not and also part of me is like embarrassed like, like I don't know. I have this thing where I feel like. I'M spoiled and and I'm behind other people, my age who are like married or on their second marriage. They have kids, I mean technically people. My age could have kids that are like getting ready to graduate high school. Actually I didn't. I didn't meet somebody two years younger than me and she has a son. That'S like you know, just sort of high school, so it's just crazy like and you feel like you're behind and so me I like, isolate and then it's like, I fall even farther behind. So it's like really rough yeah, but anyways. Luckily, I have because I have social anxiety. I feel like this. These videos are my way of getting my my emotional state and pain out into the world and hopefully realizing that I'm I'm not that bad yeah. So so that's my deal, i guess and i'll talk to you later. I yes 
50	Hey guys um, this video is very impromptu. I was not planning on making a video, Thomas or really anytime soon, but it's been something that I've been thinking about for quite some time, um Lily was cupcake. Cover tops just sent me a link to a video that she made for me and I'm absolutely beside myself to move it. You know other people are touched by my story in a way I mean, ah I'm beside myself and it's given me the push and kind of the inspiration to share my story and to tell you guys exactly what happened and the reason I want to do. This is and and the reason I've been contemplating doing this for so long, even though I said I'd never do it is because I feel like it would help more people and then it could possibly like you know, hinder me in the future or the boys. Deacon knows about it now not to this extent, but he understands why his dad's out of the picture, so I feel, like you know, in the future. Obviously he know more and maybe probably even more than what you know, I'm gon na share. But I want to share my story with you guys and explain to you guys why why I'm divorced, and maybe I mean I'm sure, some people have already kind of figured it out and put pieces together and you know able to understand why but yeah I want To share it because I feel like it might, it might help it might empower somebody it might make a difference in their life like it has mine granted. You know my life is, is harder than it's ever been, but at the same time I know that I did the right thing and I did the right thing for not only myself but for my boys and for the safety of my kids, everything you name it Like I just I know that it was the right. It was the right decision, so um, okay, so about the men. It was like the middle of Drake's pregnancy. I noticed some weird weird behavior from my ex and weird in this sense that, like you know, he'd get home and he'd go use the bathroom for an hour just like be in the bathroom for an hour. Just you know odd behavior, but nothing that I thought too much of, but he was like a little off he's a little jittery. He was a little off. I think there's a video it's probably off, but if you guys remember, I tried to play a spaghetti prank on him and I recorded it and there were. I had bought these noodles from like world market that were like two or three feet long and I just thought it'd be funny to like be trying to eat a spaghetti. Noodle and like have it be three feet long. So I did that and in that video, a really good friend of mine actually had watched it and her, and her husband had commented to me me and he's really jittery he's really. Weird is everything. Okay - and I you know even then didn't think that much of it and as as time had gone on, I started to know like we're really financially struggling, and at that time I had a great job. He had a great job we shouldn't have been, but his checks were, you know a little bit less and less and less, and I was trying to do more and more to like pick up the slack and I again I didn't think anything of it because I Thought that you know he was just putting his checks in the bank. Well, this one on and shortly after that time it kind of evolved into a really hot temper and to where everything made him snap and just flip out and yell and scream. I actually remember having a birthday I was pregnant. I was with deacon in the bathtub and I was just hysterically crying because he had just completely flipped out on us about nothing. So I have a horrible memory, horrible memory, but I do remember a few things and that was that was one of them. Specifically, I just remember trying to like hide my face in the shower curtain, so that Deacon didn't see me so upset and stuff like that carried on for a long time. So the the the verbal abuse of it it started getting really ugly and it wasn't something that you know I was necessarily comfortable with, but I blamed things like stress. I blamed things like you know, work stuff like that, and I found excuses for everything more and more. He didn't want to hang around the family. He was working six or seven days a week 13 hour days. We just weren't seeing him and when we did, he was ugly and again money kept getting tighter and tighter. This just kept getting worse and worse. It was like a snowball effect, fast-forward up a little bit to Drake's Drake's, birth, yeah and at the birth. I remember my birth video graphics, that a videographer say that when she was editing the video she couldn't find any she had like no clips with him in it cuz.
88	I'Ve been sad because you know um, and I can't really talk about this shit, which pisses me off um. I guess, but I had gone through when I was younger, has made ha has affected my life as an adult um. I think the way I was explaining today one was some people that have been molested when they were younger. When they grow up, they either do drugs. They turn to prostitution. They get obsessed with having sex um, they love older men um, and I guess the only reason. The only way to explain myself is my anxiety and depression. I was so fucked up in the head and I went through so much shit when I was younger that now it affects my life, my day-to-day life every single day um. I feel like there's not a day that goes by where I'm not sad, there's not a day that goodbye when I'm not crying, there's not a day that goes by when I would represent happy. And yes, I know that you know update Lynne. She makes me happy and I think that people that goes to what I go through you know you can't truly explain this. You can't express the way you feel um. I think that I feel like if I was given anything in the world. It wouldn't make me happy, and I feel so terrible that that Dave Len has to deal with me. It makes me sad. It'S affected, you know not affected our relationship, but I feel like every time I talk to her. I'M sad and I have to say the same thing over and over again and she doesn't quite understand, but she understands to an extent and I've noticed I'm sorry that I'm crying I'm sorry that I can't control myself, but this is a vintage Ellie. This is me expressing my my feelings, um, I feel like I feel, like I'm, making Dadeland sad. I'Ve never seen her so sad lately. She says it's because a body issue her body issues. She says they're getting to her, but I feel like me, I feel like I can't talk. No, I don't know how to say it. I feel like I have made her depressed. I'Ve put her I've. I don't know, I don't know. I honestly have no idea. Daelin is such a happy person, you guys know you see it in the videos. She'S always been a happy person, and maybe the past week or two things just have been sad it our relationship is not rocky, that's best for sure consist. Raagas has ever been I'm just saying that I feel, like my depression. Wears is wearing off on her and I feel bad and I feel sad because I would never want someone to feel the way. I feel never. And when I see her cry and when I see her sad, it breaks my heart even more: it breaks my fucking heart.
80	[, Music ]. Look how depressed I am. I don't even care about black crowns like in trouble. Why a microphone so mighty? I'M not my problem. I don't give a damn what kind of group hello! My name is Jody and I am depressed today and that's okay. What else you know I have to be kind to myself these days come my therapist told me that it was healthy to wake up and not check if you're depressed aisa wake up, and I'm like. How am I feeling today am I here. The answer is always no, I'm still spaced out still don't really feel like I'm awake, and then I go. Oh, no and now I'm depressed as well after you recommended not checking. I felt better because I was like oh yeah, I'm just going to continue with my day who says if you check, then you usually find so I stopped clock in problem. Is today I don't have to joke. Sometimes you just wake up and your brain is so heavy. You can't help but notice that so my topic today now is idea and depressed. I know so well when I'm depressed, I can just tell exactly when my brain isn't working properly. It'S very chemical. It feels very physical. There are days when I feel sad, and I know it's emotional and it's because of a situation or something that's getting me down. It'S like a weight inside my body, whereas when it's like a chemical depression, this feels black. My brain feels rotting. Nothing works like I don't get anything your chest is heavy the whole day. I just feel this constant longing for something and I'm not getting it suddenly. Nothing is easy. Everything seems terrifying and difficult and complex, and messy and heavy like nothing's, going to be okay. Ever again, and that this is the normal, this is where my head goes to naturally, and that every time I show how you're feeling better you're going to feel better again bits of life and I'm lying to myself, and this is how I should just naturally feel And I should just stop treading water and let go and give up and just fall down to this dark pit. Where I am now Wow, I should put disclaimer at the start or something this isn't a very positive video. I guess, but I interesting to catch it in the moment just might like working head. Am I not working head are so different and they don't have empathy for each other asshole when I'm feeling healthy, I'm like how on earth could I ever not feel like this? There'S so much to be happy about Anna sermon to be hopeful for why not just choose happiness and choose the hopeful route. I can't put myself in my happy minds at the moment, but that's I think, what I feel I remember just being like. Oh, I always know I'll come up afterwards, there's always enough after a down, and I will feel good again and that's what I write down in all my Diaries and on my wall. Don'T worry, you'll feel. Okay again, this is just temporary for us right now. If I was to write a message to my happy self, I don't want to do that. Obviously, I'm not going to bring you down happy me if I want to it would be like love. Stop killing yourself! I'M not going to do that because I know objectively, I'm sure this is just my brain up. No-One'S natural state should be this bad, it's so bad, so bad! Oh! This is when you know, you're depressed you just get nothing from anything I'll watch a TV show and I'll be like. I wonder what else there is to do I'll go outside now, just feel hopeless and like well. This is, I want to be outside when it's nice and feel nothing I'll go back in and back. Why don't? I just spend a whole day in bed, considering I'm not gon na get anything from anything else. When I was depressed in the summer my mum had booked this trip to like a water slide in, I don't know it's like a Groupon, whatever I'm blessed to try. I love her so much. She was like this will cheer you up and I'm like mom when you're depressed you don't really get cheered up by things. So we're a functioning happy version of me. We'Ll go down a waterslide and go. We depress me. It'S just going to feel a bit cold and uncomfortable so just kind of put the body in a slippery wet thing below in terms of where I'm at I'm still dreaming still feel very much like I'm not here. The realizations depersonalization like a car as my eyes widen, are when I look like far away from me. Everything just looks like painted on it. Just don't feel real and that's what's so frustrating and that's what gets me down. That'S what makes me depressed it's like. I know that I'm not getting the full picture of life. I feel blind. I feel like someone's, taken something away from me and it's so annoying that I used to feel so excited for feeling, everything and everything being so vivid and so much fun. And it just feels like someone sucked out the fun of every. I have to experience and I'm so scared that I'll never feel that again and that's why I get so hung up on the past all divided, because I felt it then will I ever feel that again and it feels like I never will so I just want To go back to where I can feel again, I'm sorry, I'm depressed, I'm usually a little bit kinder to myself and I'm like there's no point in just wallowing, and I find the funny treat yourself do something nice. But when I'm this bad, it's like taking a bath is just going to make me feel hot and bored going to bed is just going to make me lie in the dark. I feel bored eating edamame beans. This is actually quite nice. So that's why I did that yeah, I don't know it's just annoying when you're sitting under jock stuff is being my pain yeah, so I felt like drunk for the past four years of my life and they're like alright. Let'S get you a blood test, I guess so. I have my rose.
32	I feel particularly sad today, under the weight of the loss of that which I've left behind to be here in India has required a lot of sacrifices. I essentially had to just turn my life upside down and say goodbye, so many so many things are part of my identity. There. One thing that is really hurting my heart. Well, it's great news, but it's also heavy on me. It I work for my boyfriend's company. It'S called pretty instant and I love being a part of this company. I love being on the team like we do such great work together. It'S a it's. A photography company design for its interactive, its design for instant sharing, live from events. So it's a wonderful company. There'S an amazing team behind it and they recently, while I've been gone, had some huge wins and I just I'm like heartbroken to not be a part of it yeah. So I'm feeling really sad and you know you can be in paradise, you can. You can get the thing you want, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're gon na be happy when you're there they're still going to be they're still going to be all the all this stuff of life, all the choices and all the choices. It'S way comes down to choices. When you choose one thing, you can't have it all and I feeling the pain in mine. That'S okay! So I'm here in go karna and I'm going to use internet because I've been sitting in an Internet black hole for a while sitting on the students doorstep, but I really needed help. The lack of Internet recently just try to upload some photos from the beach has just been impossible and just just feeling really frustrated hello, yeah, alright yeah. So that's how I'm feeling today 
15	One thing I've learned is that we can chase the thing we want to the other side of the world and getting it may not make us happy. Since I've been in India, I've there's it's been wonderful, it's been awful, it's been wonderful, it's been challenging. It'S been amazing, it's been absolutely horrible and, and just incredible all at once, you know and I've been feeling a lot of frustration recently kind of like it's questioning like. Why am I here? Why am I really here like? What am I meant to be doing to be learning like what is this growth supposed to look like I mean I guess I could never know from the start. You know you never know setting onto the journey what the journey is going to contain, but I have just been feeling a lot of like frustration and confusion and just it's like searching for. I don't know what, but it hurts not having it do. You know what I mean so so far. I'Ve been in India now 19 days. I spent six days in udaipur eight days in the desert, and then you know a couple days in transit here and there I'm in Mumbai. Today I photographed a wedding here last night, which was really beautiful. I didn't make a vlog during the weddings I didn't feel was appropriate, but now I kind of regret it. But now my plan is to head down to Goa and I know I'm just still wandering and I'm still searching and I may not. You know I may not find what I'm looking for there. But then again I don't really know what I'm looking for all all. I can do is just you know, move forward and do my best to listen to my gut. You know listen to that voice within, even though it's very conflicted right now, but you know, I think people look at me and they think that I just have is like amazing, happy journey all the time, but I don't you know I really don't. This journey is like complicated, so the only thing I can do is just keep moving forward and trust the process and Trust the journey and trust in God. If I'm to assume that I'm on a spiritual journey, then you know all of this is part of that and that's beautiful and I surrender to it, and I embrace it check out this incredible beautiful view. I have right now. This is the hotel in Mumbai where I'm staying. I stayed one night, my friend Prakash Milani from Singapore, put me up here or let me crash with him. It was such an oasis. It was such an oasis in my trip and just really amazing, I'm really enjoying how clean it is. But now I'm heading back out into the I really I don't have any desire to stay in Mumbai. I just I just want to. I just want to get out of here and just move on to the next thing, all right journey on journey on fellow travelers, 
17	Then I have been this past week and, unfortunately, guys that's just part of the challenge. There'S going to be many parts of it, that's will be easy and sick and you'll feel successful and you'll feel good about things. But honestly guys, there's gon na be a lot of times when you feel down and you feel depressed and you feel anxious, and you doubt yourself and you you doubt even while you're doing the challenge. I'Ve talked about this a lot if you've been watching my videos, but one thing I kind of wanted to touch on guys is: you know if you've had issues with depression, whether on or off nofap and sadness, and loneliness, even anxiety. You know it's it's, okay, to feel that way. It'S okay to feel depressed, it's okay, to feel anxious and uncomfortable you're, entitled to your feelings and you're entitled to your emotions, we're all human beings - and you know it's it's unfortunate guys that we live in a society where it's taught that if you feel depressed, if You feel anxious or shy or uncomfortable in your own skin, that there's something wrong with you and it's from a young age, and you know we learn it in certain social situations, and you know with antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications and and all sorts of formulas and pills And things like that that are offered to us and thrown in our faces to try and help us run from our depression and our and our anxieties and our fears as humans. You know it's it's to a certain degree, our human nature, to want to run from those emotions, because we don't want to experience them, they're, not fun, but the point I want to make to you guys is it's normal to feel depressed, it's normal to feel sad. It'S an emotion, no emotion lasts forever, including happiness, including depression, anger, hate, fear, sadness. Every emotion is temporary and will pass and guys it's part of being human part of being on this planet is you're gon na go through life and you're gon na experience. Thousands of different emotions all the time from day to day - and you know one thing that you're gon na experience on nofap, which is definitely what I've been experiencing this past week, is that, whereas before you know when I had depression and loneliness and and anxiety - and I had negative emotions, I would use porn and masturbation, and even marijuana and and alcohol before, to burry my emotions and escape from the depression and to run away from those feelings, because in the back of our minds, we think that I shouldn't be feeling this way. Why am i feeling sad? You know you look around, you see so many other happy people in your life, people that are happened to be having a great day and you're having a bad day, and you just feel if you feel so different from them and and you start to wonder you Know why do I feel this way? Is there something wrong with me and, and that can definitely lead you back to your behaviors and your addictions so guys? All I want to say is it's. This is how life is it's normal to feel depressed, it's normal to feel anxious and it's normal to feel unhappy and realize that these emotions and these hard times are temporary and if you deal with them in a healthy way and you get through them. You'Re gon na become a strong-ass person, so don't beat yourself up if you're feeling sad during the challenge, if you're feeling depressed, if you're feeling guilty, let that go it's normal and don't be so hard on yourself through the process, guys it's a recovery and it's not Gon na happen overnight, and you need to be patient with yourself. So that's my point today, guys if you're, going through hard times if you're feeling down, I know January, is a cold dark difficult month for a lot of us coming out of the winter. So stay strong and if you're feeling down, if you're feeling like you're going through some rough times just know, this is part of life and no emotion lasts forever. And things will get better for you guys and take it from me because I'm going through some difficult times right now and anyways, I hope that's helped you. I hope you guys are having a good week and sticking to your goals. I'M gon na hit the sack and we'll talk tomorrow, guys hang in there. Peace

71	Okay, so today balls today, I woke up satin. Today I woke up depressed, which was weird. It was like it's weird how some days you just wake up and you feel it and you're like today. Today is not my day: huh yeah wasn't my day. It'S actually not been my day, the past two days, which is weird because there's a lot of good things happening in my life, but I have a really hard time seeing the positive, which is also weird, because I talked about seeing the positive a lot. I'M not trying to be hypocritical. I just have trouble too, so I asked why are we sitting down? I wan na chat we're just gon na which is kind of just gon na chill, and I mean I'm boiling right now and I decided to hit the hot chocolate which is boiling. I don't know why I keep sipping it so I saw my friend I don't know. If might know it's not my friend she's more of like an acquaintance. I would love to be her friend, but I don't know if she's my friend Dodie, I did a panel with her at playlist. We'Ve met a few times, we're nice people, we say hi. She made a video called. I am depressed today and I thought it was amazing. I thought it was so so real and I've been finding myself watching these type of videos a lot recently, because I've been waking up in this mood and super weird. It'S helped. It'S helped me a lot. It tell me a lot knowing that other people are going to it to really helps me, and I think that's what you guys watch this channel, and I think that that's the main reason why I wanted to make a video. I just wanted to sit down and talk cuz. I haven't a really hard time thinking about like what to film, not that it matters anyways. I don't really have a schedule anymore. I have this problem where, if I'm successful, I always find a way to bring myself down, because I don't think I should have that high of expectations in my life, like a really really good thing, happened to me last week, a massive thing out of this world. I can't what it is, I'm not trying to be that you two are saying that this students happening, but it can't tell you because they don't even know what's happening yet, but like this huge thing happened and I can't seem to like it anymore. I can't seem to enjoy the idea of it and it stresses me up and I think negatively it's a problem. I know another thing: that's kind of positive is that I've been working out a lot recently and if you follow me on Instagram, not saying actually, you should probably go follow me on Instagram it's at Joey, guinea. It looks like this, it's really cool. I love talking. You guys on there and I've been working out a lot recently, just because I wanted to get my body into a shape where you know I like it. That'S that's literally. The only reason why I'm doing it and I find them very hard on myself at the same time like I'm like, oh, I don't have like the packs of this guy and I think, like a lot, a lot there's a lot of stigma in men's health. We always look at that cover or we look at that Instagram picture, whatever we're like wow. We want to be that guy. I want to be that big, you know or small whatever you want in life and it's really been stressing me out lately, but like it's a good thing, I don't know when to stop another thing that have been kind of going about lately and I haven't really Told the main channel this I got into school again, which is really cool yeah. I got into like a really cool program, it's kind of like my dream program right now for school, and I don't know if I want to go, not because I don't like to school. I mean I've already graduated from college, if you don't already know, but it's just like I don't know. If I want to look back, is that taking a step back? I know education like my problem. Is I'm not from this my problem? I know everything. I know the the reason why we feel things and everything like that and why I'm feeling the way I do and there's like pros and cons to everything I and I get both sides of like why I shouldn't go and why I should go. But I'm like. I have a really hard time figuring. What the middle is. I'M not asking for you to help me but, like I don't know, if you relate to this a comment down below yeah, so I'm really straight, I'm stressing about school everyone's like go, go, go and I'm like what is it for what, if I'm putting a hole To my career, what, if I'm taking a step backwards? What, if I get this this crazy opportunity and I'm stuck in school and then the other side of me is thinking like well, it's just school. You can leave it and do it again if this opportunity is that amazing, you just cool, and so I'm like okay I'll go to school, but then the other side comes back with another point in this side comes, I go and it's just this. Oh I don't. Even want to go I'll figure it out. I haven't cleaned lately, I'm a big clean person, i spilt hot chocolate, the powder and I still haven't cleaned it, I'm looking at it and it's bugging me, but I probably won't do it until tomorrow. Actually I'll probably do it tonight, but I hate I don't clean anymore, because three people, three people came over to my place and they're like well, you clean and I felt really insecure and I'm not trying to be a hypocrite III tweeted today and I was like I hate people who preach things that they don't do and, like I preach about being yourself, but I I don't know why.
11	I was depressed hi, you guys so today, I'm going to be making a little bit more of a serious video. I'M going to talk about my experience with depression. Now I've been super open about my eating disorder on this channel, as well as on my blog as well as just in person, because I feel like that's something. Not a lot of people talk about, and I haven't really said much about my experience with depression and not because I'm ashamed of it or anything like that. I just I don't know. I just haven't really said anything. I don't think there's really a reason for it, but the other day I saw a tweet from a girl that I knew that essentially just said. I can't stand depressed. People just be happy. It'S your choice, and I kind of like hit me that so many people are uneducated about depression and then to go along with that. I watched the last episode of 13 reasons. Why yesterday - and I can honestly say that it wrecked me and I'm sure everyone else cried, you know like everyone was, it was a sad episode, so I'm sure everyone else cried and was upset about it or something. But I was just thinking about like this. Just really happens, people really get to a point where they're so depressed that they want to end their life, and so I just thought this could maybe be informative about what it's like to have depression. So maybe you don't have depression, but you might know someone who does and you don't. You have no idea what they're going through and you may be it like makes you uncomfortable to talk to them about it. So I just kind of wanted to share this. Maybe it would help someone so my depression kind of went hand-in-hand with my eating disorder and before I start I do want to say that depression does run in my family, so it can be kind of like passed down genetically and so anyways. When I was going to treatment, I really I really really didn't want to go to treatment. I had no interest in going and it was just something I I really really fought and in fighting this it's just all. I just felt like everything like tumbling right. Nothing was going right, which kind of caused me to spiral into this depression. So my best friend had kind of forced me to tell my parents about my eating disorder, which made me really uncomfortable and so upset, and then my parents were upset and then I started feeling like. I had caused all these issues and it just downward spirals into this depression, so this is kind of how it felt for me. So to start I just felt like I had let everyone down I felt like I was a problem to everything that was going on. Like I was the cause of all the issues that were happening in my household with my friends, and I just kept thinking like like people's lives, would be so much easier without me. I wouldn't be here to cause all this chaos in these issues and, like my parents, wouldn't have to pay for another kid and they would be like better off financially and they wouldn't my mom, wouldn't be so stressed out about me, and these were the thoughts that Just kept going on in my mind, and I can't tell you how many times I repeated the phrase I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to do this anymore and I just repeated them all. The time in my mom was so worried. You guys she was so freaked out as any parent would be. If you have a child coming home saying I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to be here anymore. Over and over and over again and just sobbing and that's what it was like, I just was like crying all the time, and I was I don't want to be here. I don't want to do this anymore and, of course this was all during the phase of me going to patient like treatment, so I just kept repeating. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to do the same work to the point where my mom got so freaked out. She slept in my room with me every night because she was afraid I was going to hurt myself every night she slept in there, for I don't even remember how long like I want to say a few weeks to like a month or something just every single Night because she was so afraid and then so, the crying happened a lot at first and then kind of after a while. I wasn't crying as much and I just didn't even want to get out of bed. I didn't go. I didn't go to school, for I can't remember so it was like two or three weeks, but I did not go to school because I just physically couldn't get myself to get out of bed. I don't even know the words for that. I just you hear people say they can't get out of bed in the morning, but I just like, because there's really no way to describe what you're feeling it's like. I just I can't I can't do it today and it's not like. I was getting bullied or anything at school. It'S not like school. Is this terrible place? I was just in this mindset of like I can't. I don't want to do this anymore. I guess to kind of help explain this mindset I used to have a tumblr dedicated to just.
28	So I was thinking I've been pretty open about the fact that my sister committed suicide in 2007. And I've been getting a lot of questions from people on the internet of, like I 
18	Let'S cover the physical side of things, so from a physical standpoint, taking the actual overdose is easy. You know you just take the right amount of pills, the right kind of pills down up with some water and then go to sleep and then the rest is is a mystery. Almost you don't know what you you're going into. You hope that you don't wake up, but if you do wake up, you're gon na be in a lot of pain. Okay, when I woke up, I I remember first of all was in hospital and a catheter in my genitals. You know having a tube in there. So could used, you know, go to the toilet. That was pretty unpleasant in itself. My my stomach or my kidneys. All of that downstairs area was painful. It really hurt. It was kind of like a clenching feeling like when you've not eaten for a while. When you start to feel like you know, starting to tighten up kind of feels like that, a mixture of that and needing the toilet really badly, it's just so much discomfort down there. It'S it's horrible and obviously having I had a tube in each arm. You know cannula, so I believe they're called a drip has obviously dripping water into my it's my body to try and flush out everything, obviously being hooked up so heart monitor as well. Now you're just lying there. You can't really do anything. You can't really move. You feel so disorientated, it's horrible actually, and you can see that the heart monitor in the hospital and it's just beeping beeping, and you just you feel so uneasy. You feel it's horrible. You know just lying in that hospital bed. You can't move because you've got neither one each on, you know, you've got a catheter in in there and then we can do stare and think it's horrible. It'S really this comforting so yeah from a physical standpoint. It hurts it's uncomfortable. You just want to move. You want to get up, but you can't because you feel so weak and so drained, and then you start to get with withdrawal from if you're taking it. If you take medication, that's what you've overdosed on. Let'S get withdrawal cuz, I'm not gon na. Let you take it you've already said too much again. That makes you feel nauseous such a horrible feeling. You know, and you don't feel like eating hungry, but you don't feel like eating. That'S that's unpleasant! So from the physical standpoint taken over those horrible from emotional and a mental perspective is even worse, I remember waking up seeing my whole family. You know my mum dad stepdad, I know I'm waking up and the first thing I see is then I start to cry. I feel ashamed. I also feel disappointed disappointed because I failed and what I said. I failed in ending my life and I felt like a failure, because I've put myself in a position where they can see that I mean. Obviously I look back now. I'M glad that I woke up. You know, I'm really glad that I did and I'm here today at the time I didn't want to wake up, so I just felt miserable. I felt depressed I felt so emotional. You know I couldn't hold back the tears just looking at all of them, and you know I thinking sorry for what I've done. It'S obviously they care so much. I think you know they they they cared so much about me and they say obviously still do. Let'S put them in that position was horrible and again my own disappointment in myself not carrying it out, and I was glad to see my family surrounding me, knowing that I was loved, but disappoint that I didn't follow through. I mean obviously now not disappointed. I'M glad that I woke up, but just laying there in that hospital bed off the sing. After seen the looks on their faces. I can't forget, you know just sad shocked, hoping that I would pull through folks so uneasy. Emotionally, I felt ashamed of myself. I felt bad for them. I felt like a disappointment for them. I felt disappointed myself for not caring, yeah following through and ending it.
41	It was at his house so yeah it was strange but um, so he moved to Texas and with his new job he he couldn't get medical insurance, for, I think at least a month or 3 months, or something like that. So because he didn't have his medical insurance and he had this move, and you know you know that that costs a lot he couldn't at that point afford to get his expensive medication for his seizures. So he just wasn't taking it and I'm just I just look back and I think like like I had extra money I could have. I know I can't do this to myself, but it's like, I could have helped him or something I could have given him money and spotted him for his medication. But I didn't, I didn't know how serious it was so having you know, an issue with having seizures and not having his medication and not being on his medication. For a month I got a call one night from someone on NC a saying that they found Chris's body. It was like the middle of the night, it was, I don't know it was after midnight, like 12:30 1:30, and they said they found his body and I just obviously broke down, and it's so weird, it's so weird when you have this person that you care about And you talk to them every single day and one day you just can't talk to them anymore. I know I don't cry about this anymore. I just also don't talk about it, and so I woke my parents up and I I was you know. I grew up going to church, so I told my mom like it was a Saturday night. I think it was the 4th of October 4th or 5th of October. I don't one of those dates. I just cried to my parents and I I told them look. I need to go to church tomorrow like I need. I need something. I need something to feel better, I own, I don't know it was so hard to come Bria and, if you've ever lost someone, I just remember being so depressed. I just wanted to sleep all the time I would take naps through the day and every single morning I wake up or anytime I'd wake up from a nap. I would remember that it's real and I would think like this. This can't be real. There has to be some way some way just to like reverse time and like stop it. There has. There has to be some way to make it, so this isn't real. This can't be real, and I remember just I I used to be so excited to get text from him every day and any time anyone would text or call me. My stomach would just drop and I'd get so sad because I knew would never beat him again and I would call his voicemail just so. I can dial this number and I remember I even texted his phone a few times even after it was gone just because it was so hard to think I'm never going to get another text on my phone with his name popping up or another call with his Name popping up - and I was just so depressed - obviously that's not something everyone, everyone dies, everyone loses people, but not everyone loses someone that they love at such an early age. Like you know, romantically love and I never even told him that I never got to. I always felt it. I always wanted to tell him that, but I never told him that and that's really difficult that I never got to say that to him and I, when I get depressed I can't eat like. I just had no appetite, and so I didn't eat or drink water, pretty much like very minimal food or water for a week or two. Maybe it was a week and I woke up one morning. I think my dad was on a business trip, so I was sleeping in the room with my mom and I remember waking up one morning I was so dizzy and I walk out to the living room to my mom and she looks at me and she's like What is wrong with you - and I was just like - I don't know, and she said that my face was white. My lips were white. I was just pale as a ghost she says she said that I looked and I went to go into the bathroom and I just passed out. So she took me to the doctor and they had to hook me up to an IV all day long, because I was severely severely dehydrated. It was really bad and it's not like. I was trying to not eat or drink. I just like I said when I'm depressed it's really hard, and that was the most depressed. I'Ve obviously ever been and then came his funeral.
43	But I am in in the IT world and I am in a competitive field and good jobs are hard to come by sometimes but the primary positive that I think I always you know looked at on top of that was given my history. If you will the job that I had up until the point of this Queen was secure because in the federal government for the most part, unless you're really messing up the likelihood of you losing your job is slim benign. They have to literally you I'm sure you guys have been around people that are on federal, but it comes a time where you have to ask yourself: is this really worth it? Is this worth? You know the energy that I'm pouring into it? Is this where I want to be, and ultimately, when I say given my history, I don't think I've left a job on the mutual. You know. Oh well, you know I'm just going somewhere else and pursue this blah blah blah. I don't think I've ever left a corporate America job on that note from the military, my job with CSC after job, what, after it's all been because people tend to believe that they can treat you any kind of way. They can talk to you any kind of way and basically you're going to excuse me you're, going to tolerate it for a paycheck and unfortunately, and sadly, a lot of people will. I cannot begin to say how elated I was to quit and yeah. I quit in a very epic fashion, but it was well deserved. Given the history of what I was dealing with, you know working there and at the end of the day, I'm not gon na. Allow any place to put me in the position that my health is in jeopardy. You know when it comes down to it. You have to ask yourself: is this place worth my health, this place where my sanity am I going through? All of these things? Excuse me all of these things, for what for the benefits yeah, I mean incredible benefits of top-notch, but at the end of the day, if it's your job, that's making you sick or making you more sick. What'S the point defeating the purpose so either way I left and my being there really made me realize some things and that's what I was about to go into, but I will start off with that when I said you know given my history and how, for the Most part, I've left jobs. I'Ve come to learn about myself that me and corporate America. Don'T work me and general corporate in it, and I can't even say it's corporate America, the kind of people that occupy supervisory positions or positions where believe they have. This perceived level of authority over you, we don't mix because I'm not the kind of person that's gon na allow somebody to just talk to me any kind of way, especially someone who cannot do my job. You see in my current situation, then I just left. I had a supervisor that knows shit about IT, not even in the textbook context, but you want to tell me how to do my job. You see, I don't have a problem with suggestions, but when you don't know what someone's job entails and you don't know how to do their job and you're their supervisor, here's some advice for anybody that may be in that position. Trust that your employee knows what they're doing, especially if they've been there a long time, allow them to do their job and sure that they keep you up-to-date on what's going on, but other than that. If you don't know how to do the job leave people alone, because at the end there's a what happens when that person leaves you see, I was the only IT for the past six years, so you replace the body. You can't replace the expertise, because that's a level of continuity for that place, so I'm just over it and at the end of the day. That'S that's just that me and corporate America don't get along because you have people in their perceived perception of authority. That wants to abuse it and think that everybody's going to just tolerate it, I'm gon na go ahead and say about 90 percent of people probably will tolerate it. I'M not part of that 90 percent.
87	Okay, so I'm a mess right now and I was actually going to shower even though it's almost three o'clock, but the water was all cold. So no luck, but this being a mess kind of made me want to talk about something that I've really been wanting to talk about for a while anyway. So well they're a lot of the time I think of myself as ugly, and I don't think that that's a bad thing. A lot of the time is just something that I can accept and be cool with and get on, and I can just be okay with it. Just like a lot of overweight people, don't want to be told that they're not fat. I don't want to be told that I'm not ugly. I don't want to call myself unconventionally pretty. I am happy a lot of the time to think of myself as ugly. I think ugliness only becomes a problem when you let it get in the way of your life end of living. I can't say that I've, never let that happen, but it's something that I'm dealing with and I'm generally okay with when my appearance really gets to me and I'm feeling really gross about it. I try to remember a few things. One is that I am beautiful in some way, because I'm a living thing - and I think living things to me at least - have some inherent beauty. There was an interview with Johnny Depp a long time ago, which I saw on YouTube somewhere, and I think he was asked something like what is your greatest turn-on and he said breathing. You might have just been saying that to be funny or whatever, but it's kind of true there's something really sexy and really beautiful about being alive and when you think about being alive - and you put that into perspective - and you just think about the smallest and biggest Thing just breathing prettiness seems to become so insignificant and just tiny, tiny. So one way I can saw myself is by reminding myself that I am beautiful, because I am Alive because I am breathing, and that is amazing. Another way that I can soul myself or deal with it is by putting things again into perspective. I think about the universe and I think about human beings as a species and how actually ridiculous. We look. Other mammals and I've got four legs and have some kind of really elegant, gait or I mean even cows, just seem like kind of magical beings, whereas humans are covered in hair, but you can't see most of it. You just see like stuff that comes out of their heads. Randomly we've got these facial features that are just like very strange, even when looking at beautiful people, if you look at them long enough, it just starts to look like ridiculous to me. At least we don't have this elegance or majestic beauty as a species that Lions have or birds or anything when you put it into this perspective, everything just seems absurd. It'S not absurd to recognize that you're not way that a lot of other people look, but it's absurd when you waste too much time on it. When you look at the perspective of being part of this kind of silly looking species on this planet in this solar system, in this universe, that is huge and contains life-forms that we haven't even encountered yet and that are completely foreign to us. Think about that and then I come back to my face in the mirror and god I wish I just had cheekbones or some kind of facial definition. It'S it's tiny. Another thing that goes along with the breathing and the living is that we are living creatures, which means that we're not just alive but we're doing things. Even when we're not consciously trying or aware of things we're breathing and when you actually do things other than that. When you get out and you're doing stuff and when you're really engaged and excited in something, I feel like the last thing that I care about is how I look. I never want to get into this place where I feel like what I look like is more important than what I do and it seems like it's a lot easier to. Let myself not do anything and to hold back, because I don't feel that I have a certain appearance for some reason that that exempts me from having to do things. But it makes me any less capable, but it doesn't, it might make it harder and - and it might take work on my part but being beautiful, is not an accomplishment and being ugly have to stop you from making accomplishments. I talked about the show my mad fat diary the other day, but I didn't touch on one of the main basic reasons that I really loved it because I just didn't feel I had enough time and it didn't fit in the video. But basically, that show is just this grand statement, the work of art showing that you can be fat or you can be ugly or you can be whatever it is, that you are and you can still live and you can still find happiness and you can still Be hopeful and you can make relationships and have friends and have lots of fun and be a good human being and grow and be happy and do the things that you want to do, and that means a lot to me. I don't think that we get that message enough or when we do get it. It'S coming from the people who are already seen, it's really pretty so it doesn't just doesn't have the same effect on me. That show has given me a lot of inspiration. There'S a quote, but from Kristen Stewart at which I'm sure tons of other people have said, which is just it's okay, to not be okay, and I think that's one of the great things of the show is that it lets. You know that it's okay to not be okay, but also that it's okay to be okay and that you can just be okay. You don't have to be beautiful to be okay, you don't have to be pretty to be okay, you don't have to be skinny to be okay, you don't have to have muscles to be okay, you don't have to have anything, you can just be you and you Can be okay with that and you don't have to be okay with that all the time and you can still struggle with it, but you can still find some kind of acceptance and love and happiness for yourself, and that is HUGE. Ah, the first episode of my mad fat diary is just really fantastic too, because it deals with all these insecurities about her body and you think that the character ray is gon na cave into it and she's gon na relapse, and just let her insecurities about her Body take over, but she doesn't and she just has fun and she laughs and she does things and she doesn't let it get in the way of her living, and that is what I think we need to review reminded of more and what I try to remember. Whenever I get dragged down by the mirror or when I notice myself watching myself from within whenever I'm out somewhere, I can be things and I can do things and I don't have to let my body or my insecurities about it, get in the way of what I really want, and sometimes I feel beautiful and I think that's an important thing to recognize too that whether anyone else can see me that way that I can and ultimately feeling, beautiful or feeling ugly can feel like the same thing as long as you don't feel. Like either one of them has to get in the way of what you can do and of who you can be because they shouldn't and they don't, and that is something that I am trying to remember always

2	Hi there I want you to pay close attention to this video because it's coming from a different place than all my other videos. Normally I give advice on how to be successful, how to be happy, but this video I'm not doing good at all and in fact I'm really fucked up. I'M depressed, I feel hopeless, I'm lost I'm confused and - and I just I feel like there's something inside of me - that is just empty. Like there's this part of me, that's empty! Tell you what guys, I think, a lot about a lot of things about everything and I think too much it kind of gets in the way of living a normal life. You know I can't have fun. I can't work. I can't socialize. I don't have good relationships with friends or family or people. You know the main reason why I try to help people out on my channel. Making videos give you advice is because I'm not satisfied with my life. I feel like the life I've gone through so far suck. Now a lot of people come to me, or they tell me that I shouldn't be doing this because I'm only 18. Why would I give advice to people? Because I haven't been through anything my life that pisses me off because you're right, I haven't, I shouldn't be a motivational speaker, because I have never gone through tragedies in my life, for example, I've never been homeless, I've never been addicted to drugs and never almost lost. My life, I've never been abused, then nothing but tell you what I'm doing what I'm doing right now, because it's my therapy, I have to give advice to people I have to whether it be writing blogs or or making these videos, because I'm just trying to understand Life and trying to figure out what's real, how to live my life and all these answers that, maybe I shouldn't think about what I do you know some people can handle their problems by doing drugs having sex some people. They work harder than anybody else, but that's because they're trying to fill something inside themselves. Some people express themselves through music through dance through physical things. Like exercise. You know, I don't know everybody's problems, but I know that my way of dealing things is usually to try to just understand life and try to find something from it. Try to understand it and then the other way I handle it and I'll be brutally honest with you is. I try not to face my problems. I try to run away from them and not take responsibility and not face them because it sucks and I feel like a loser when I do so there. I just told you one of the darkest things about me, so why am I telling you all this? The reason why I'm saying this to you is because I'm trying to express to you where I'm coming from trust me, I don't want to depress you by this video, make you feel worse. But there's one thing that I understand from the things that I've learned this. So far in life, I have learned that everybody has problems, that we all struggle through something going on internally, whether it be insecurities or something that we just don't understand. I don't know and like I said, we handle in different ways, but I think that sometimes we do things to cover up or try to fill in that space inside of you that emptiness with those activities, but they don't actually do it. They can't fill you permanently and I tell you what what I'm about to say is not my own thoughts. I got this from somebody else. In fact, if you go study, existentialism you'll find a lot of things in that subject. Talking about meaning and what i heard from somebody recently is that probably the one thing that people want in life, more than anything, is meaning, and maybe meaning is what will fill that in. So I want to remind you right now, I'm not doing good. I really fucked up and depressed because I can't figure out what to do so. Listen I've been trying to figure out how to take this person inside of me and bring it out cuz. I know I can be a smart person, a cool person, a responsible person, somebody who has everything together. You know someone who has my own shit together and because you see this a lot and people, people just don't have their shit together. People are messed up, people have problems like I said there are some people who seem to have everything figured out, so I'm trying to be one of those people and what I've done so far is I've tried to understand everything you know. I study how to be successful, how to be relationships, how to how to make money, how to how to be attractive to people in general, and I tell you what I've learned a lot and I understand a lot and I'm gon na share that with you on My channel, but there's something deeper.
24	I just I'm a happy bubbly person, you know what I'm saying and that's one thing I want to say. Y'All know me, as the goofy, the goofy motherfucker, who, who make everybody else, laugh deep down, I'm hurting on the inside. So if you got a friend, that's always making you laugh or anybody else laugh around around you or anything like that. If you have a friend like that man check on them, because they not all right, they not okay, you know, I'm saying it's always the goofy, the goofy quiet wise. You know what I'm saying check on check on them check on y'all our peoples, man, they not! Okay, man and I feel for them it's just like when you walk around with y'all, hey trying to hold your head, I feel like making other people who laugh and happy man. That was like that's kind of like it's kind of like a stable thing for depression. I don't know why, but it seemed like all the goofy people, all the comedians and all the comedians. They really be depressed as fuck like Robin Williams. He was an on-set. I don't know him. You plan on a movie mr. doll, fair and other classics, and I'm saying I can't really thinking on top of my head. No, I can't really thinking off the top of my head. Only thing that came to my head was miss out her and he was a famous comedian. He killed himself suicide and I feel like people, don't take people, don't a depression, serious enough until it's too late. You know what I'm saying until it's too late and every time I think about him, like you know what I'm saying I feel like he really made other people laugh and smile, but this nigga really was hurt and he really was hurt. I'M just like I'm making this video I'm making this video too. I don't know, what's next one y'all, I don't know what guy has the story for me. I don't know what I should do next with my next movie. Honestly, I'm just you know, I'm just going through the motions right now. You know it's kind of tough, it's kind of tough man. I'Ve been talking to Chris a lot man. He actually wants me to come down there. He actually want me to come down there visit just you know, sancious be around be around somebody. You know I'm around jazz, but it's just like that'd be like a breath of fresh air just going down to another state, and just you know just hanging around somebody. You know, I know that shit might sound weird, but it might sound weird because y'all fracking blood y'all, you got just a nigga round, but it's different when you'll be around somebody 24/7 like every day. There'S nothing bad about it, but it is. It feel good to get a knob some breath of fresh air. You know I'm saying get out and hang around somebody ledge or something like that or it don't matter, but I just I just might end up. You know I'm saying I'm leaving I'm not sure you um, I'm not even showing that, but guys know I love her. I love my daughter to death. I don't play about neither one of them. I just got some stuff to figure out on my own. The reason I'm making this video and I'll probably make a cute. I probably do the Q
