https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1kNNYie2u0		why i HATE my life..	hey guys so I have really bad lighting so I'm really sorry I'm not wearing any makeup or hair extensions or literally anything before we get into this video if there's it's gonna be long it's gonna be a long video and I do jump around a lot my mind is very much all over the place all the time so I'm sorry try and grasp everything as you can try and listen as intently as you can and yeah maybe grab a snack if that's what you want I'm just gonna start with a quick summary of when I was younger pretty much when I was younger my sister has as an actual mental illness she battles with bipolar manic bipolar disorder and depression and anxiety and we didn't know that I'm growing up my sister is eight years older than I am so say if I was eight she was sixteen or if I was you know ten she was 18 and basically around those age groups for me and my sister was when my sister was exhibiting symptoms of her illnesses and my mom didn't know you know that was my sister was my mom's first child so she didn't really know why my sister was acting like this she kind of just thought it was her acting out and just being a rebellious kid you know but my sister would take things a little far for example running away or just doing pretty much every bad thing that a parent is caution towards their child or like tries to prevent their child to do my sister did so pretty much she would go out with friends and lie about where she was going or she would have the friends pretend to be say their parents or something and lie about it something like that just pretty much all those horrible things there's no way many times and basically like I just needed to give y'all a little backstory of like my childhood and then growing up also we didn't live in like a big fancy house or anything we lived in like a two-bedroom apartment that was a very small apartment in New York my sister I don't think I don't think did much when I was a kid in New York but when we moved to where we live now which is Georgia my sister had been older and she started exhibiting signs and you know there was just basically a lot of fights that I experienced and they were pretty bad fights that was just what I grew up with I cried a lot growing up I was very scared a lot I'm trying to not cry either because I don't think it's really gonna do anything if I cry but I'm sorry I cry moving on from that all my life I I've also been very very very protected and I don't believe I've been protected and the most healthiest ways I think I've honestly been protected in the most worst ways possible like I said my sister used the light of my mom a lot and pretty much not be a good child at all and my mom took that out on me she tried to prevent me from doing everything my sister did like she basically took everything that my sister did and then all the consequences that she might have given my sister or try to maybe give my sister she threw it on me also and basically I was on to go out kind of mentioned this in some videos in a video before I think it was my mom but I didn't really go into as serious it actually affected me because this is something that actually does affect me daily even now and I'm 20 years old I'm 22 I can't do anything nothing on mom basically never let me go out I couldn't go to the movies I couldn't go to the mall I couldn't hang out with friends I couldn't go to anybody's house nobody would could come to ours and my mom never wanted to drive me anywhere she would always say she was too tired after work um which is understandable yeah she was a single parent she just had to take care of me and my sister so she was tired and you know my mom does have her reasons for things I believe ultimately she does my mom doesn't mean any harm but I don't think she realizes a No most parents realize when they're doing wrong for by their kids and I don't think my mom realized that for me because she treated me as if I was a second version of my sister and I'm nothing like my sister I don't think that's how you should treat kids I don't think that's how someone should treat their kid and trust me I mean I've gone I've spoken to the few friends I've had about this I've spoken to a therapist about this therapist wasn't even really an actual therapist I mean I guess he was but it was a counselor that they gave us through the school that's a whole other story but I've tried talking to other people about this they've even tried talking to my own mother and I'm saying all of this before anybody tries to come at me and say oh well maybe you shouldn't post this maybe you should talk to somebody like I've tried and I feel like honestly I'm at a point where I don't know who else to talk to and so I was never really allowed to socialize I wasn't allowed to pretty much do a lot of teenagers did growing up and of course I couldn't have a boyfriend either so on lately with learning things about people and experiencing like fake friends and experiencing how guys treat women and I'm I'm just late with all of that and it sucks because I'm not a point where mentally I feel like I'm mature and should be in a relationship with a man that actually treats me right but I've just been dealing with so many boys that's all I'm sorry to like it just sucks sick do not shelter your kids as much as I was sheltered like look I feel like you should let your kids experience life you should let them experience heartbreak let them experience how horrible people are because as much as you want to protect them and you want to keep them happy ultimately here so hurting them because they didn't get to experience I'm gonna stop crying my camera just fell how do you just broke it but it just fell so I'm sorry if the position or lighting is different or whatever but don't shelter your kids as much as my mom did to me anyone that has kids was going to have kids don't do all of the things that I just listed in fear that your kids going to die or that your kids going to end up with the wrong crowd because unfortunately and I know this I'm sorry if this sounds heartless I'm sorry if this sounds horrible but everything happens for a reason I don't want to say people die for a reason but I do believe that God knows when it is your time and unfortunately lots of times people think that kids are peer pressured into things which some kids are some kids are peer pressured into things but some kids also voluntarily choose to do bad things and you have to realize that that is your kids decision they're going to learn and they're going to grow from their decisions you cannot prevent them from doing what they want to do because ultimately they're still gonna do it they're still gonna learn on their own their own way because you're not teaching them it's not your job to teach them the only job I believe a parent has towards their kids is to love and accept and support them not change them not restrict them not challenge them not ridicule them don't punish them don't be negative towards your kids because all your kids gonna know is negativity and what not to do not what they should do not how they should handle things not how they should deal with things cuz honestly I don't know a hell of a lot of things because I wasn't allowed to experience them I don't I didn't know people treat you so shitty when you get older and that people lie and people are manipulative and people are actually pretty freakin horrible on the inside I didn't know that I was I know and I know high school doesn't tell you all of these things you don't learn all of that in high school but I probably would have been somewhat more you know aware of these things if I was able to actually go out and going back to my whole family situation my whole family is foreign maybe you should have started out with that but none of them are from America they all came from South America from a country called Guyana I feel like I'm kind of getting ahead of myself in this so I'm gonna backtrack uh but basically when I was a girl wasn't I'll do anything I never got to experience a lot of things I'm very awkward I'm very socially awkward so awkward and you know growing up I was also extremely restricted on everything everything from my clothes down to my eyebrow shape I couldn't do what I wanted to do and as my sister got older she for some reason became like a second mom so it was like I had two parents I don't know why my sister thought she could do this I guess she felt in her way that yes like every other sister is protective of the younger sister but sometimes my sister would take it too far - and I would he yelled out a lot I was yelled out a lot to help my childhood hey even get yelled at when I cry and I get told to stop crying so whenever I cry now it's actually an automatic reflex to try and make myself stop right because I've been told every time I cry to not cry I don't have a reason to cry don't cheat your kids like Craig's okay but I mean that I was a strict is ever instance if when I was younger I wanted to pick out clothes safe you know when you're kids you like to pick out like bright things cuz you know you're bright and happy and whatever and I remember a time I think I picked out something that was red because something that was red and my mom made fun of me my mom laughed at me she said I didn't know anything about fashion and I've been told this for years I would get laughed at have you laughed at for a lot of things and one of the things I would get lapped up be closed and it would be like I didn't know how to dress I didn't know style I didn't know fashion I didn't know what I wanted to wear I would always get told I didn't know what I wanted growing up my mom still tries to tell me this and 20 and she would say you don't know anything you don't know what you want you don't know like that's just what I would get told so growing up I kind of got some point that I didn't I felt like I didn't know what I wanted but a bigger burning thing inside of me would say that you do know what you want you do know what you like you just can't get it with my family I feel like it should be that oh you know the way my family treated me I know how I'm gonna treat my kids like my kids are gonna be like this because how I shooted I could never say that like never I know how to not treat my kids because of my family and by family too because I'm not just I'm not just talking about my mom my sister I'm also talking about on my dad's side and on my mom's side all her aunts and uncles I mean all her sisters I mean they're all very very very strict very strict on my mom's side the family the women are very very very very conservative you have to cover up you can't wear certain things or do certain things or act certain ways like you have to be extremely extremely proper and it's kind of like that on my dad's side as well everyone's extremely sort of uptight they're both very very uptight parts of family but another thing is that one's also very judgmental very judgmental and I know every family has their own quirks I've been family has their own drama and issues and stuff like that but it's just like I've gotten to a point where I do not want to be around anyone in my family except for maybe my cousins because they're closer to my age and they can relate to me I am such an expressive person I like to express myself I like to go out I like to do things go on adventures I mean I consider adventures but I could literally just go to the store or go to the movies and it would be an adventure for me I would have fun or I'm gonna walk in a trail somewhere go on a hike or just stuff like that that brings me happiness those moments make me happy but with my family those things don't matter you know for them when they came to America and I'm trying to explain to y'all how I believe their perspective is they came to America with the sight of the quote/unquote American dream to get far up in life to be successful and to have a better life they basically built up their fortune at this point and that is pretty freakin amazing look that's great for them but growing up as an American child and experiencing things completely differently you have a completely different view on the world my camera died again so I had to change the angle again and I'm sorry I don't really remember who I was but I'm gonna try and go back to where I was talking about then restricting everything I wasn't allowed to do what I wanted to do three years and I mean years I couldn't pick out what I wanted I couldn't literally do anything I wanted for a long time probably until my junior year of high school was when I was actually able to dress how I wanted no I take that back sophomore year of high school so I wasn't allowed to literally do anything growing up and it affects a person like I said before I would always get told you don't want this so you don't know what you want you don't this you don't like I would always get told that I didn't know what I wanted when I did I couldn't even go to someone's house for like two hours like that wasn't a thing that wasn't even a question and to put in another perspective of how my mom was towards me trying to see other people she say if I asked her same there was a girl named Cindy and I want to go to Cindy's house my mom would say no the Cindy obviously shows know who Cindy is she's never met Cindy she's also gonna know these Indians but she would ask me these questions and I would say she's a girl from school my mom would go you want to go to some random girl's house from school that I don't even know and I would be like well you can meet her I don't want to meet her well you could meet her parents I don't want to meet her parents and that's how the conversation would go every time if it ever got any farther than that you would say where does Cindy's parents live they live in this neighborhood oh I don't like that neighborhood you can't go there my mom probably doesn't even know majority of the neighborhood's that I've wanted to go and hang out in people's houses like where they live but she would automatically say no you can't go there or if the neighborhood was like 30 minutes away - my mom and my whole family that lives in Georgia like everyone on my mom's side 30 minutes away 30 minutes away you guys is like I'm driving like a day like that's how they make it seem like you're driving 30 minutes you have to go that far that's the response I get oh and God forbid it's an hour an hour for me or I'm just jamming out to music and honestly not caring I'm just excited to get to wherever I'm going feels like above most 15 minutes an hour to me is not a long drive at all it's not especially if I actually want to go somewhere it's not a long drive 30 minutes is basically like five minutes 30 minutes is not long at all if I maybe in 30 minutes of traffic yeah it feels like forever but if I'm 30 minutes driving somewhere it's not far and in Georgia if you live in Georgia and you can relate and I might just be anywhere in the south in general everything is far coming from someone who used to live in the north where you can literally walk to wherever your destination was you cannot do that in the south you have to drive so whenever someone says oh it's down the street down the street literally means it's about a ten minute drive which would translate to probably a 20 to 30 minute walk in New York if you say oh it's down the street down the street literally means that most like a 10 minute walk it's very different mom would only ever want to drive me places - growing up she would ever only ever want to drive me places before I got a car that why Wow most like 15 minutes away driving like my mom never wanted to drive me somewhere that was longer than 15 minutes away because she was tired I don't know which I felt like after a while it wasn't that she was tired it was just that she just didn't want to and honestly like if you guys think that by the end of this video if you think I'm exaggerating if you think my family and my mom the way I was shooted is fine like if you think this is all normal comment down below maybe maybe I am extremely sensitive I know I am sensitive but maybe I'm oversensitive maybe I'm I'm just too I don't know something like maybe I'm just maybe I'm wrong like tell me tell me if I'm wrong tell me if everything that I've been said so far that I've been treated so far it's fine it's okay cuz apparently my family thinks it's fine whenever I bring it up to them so maybe other people think it's fine too and then of course there's the fear of like dying you know my family thinks that they can't trust anybody which is fine like yes you cannot trust people that you just meet especially if you don't know them but lots of times there are people that are pretty harmless it's hard my family also as I said before they're very judgmental they feel as if school is the only way school is the only way to be successful in life the only way and yes to a lot of people they feel that a degree is the only surefire way to get any form of income but I personally as someone who is extremely open-minded I don't think that I think now that times are changing things are evolving there are different ways to create income for yourself getting a degree getting a piece of paper that will please society that thrives on how far your piece of paper has gotten you it's kind of sucks in my opinion that we live in a society that says you need a piece of paper and by piece of paper I mean a degree but it's ultimately a piece of paper that says you did this many hours of school and you know this much amount of knowledge and that's how much you're worth and I mean that's how much you're worth because that's how much money you're gonna make so that's how much you're worth I don't think that's okay I don't think that's accurate I don't think that's the only way either for instance I have a social media account I do make income off of this I was at one point which I'm not right now because if I were I would have definitely moved out at this point I was making income enough to pay a whole semester of college I didn't have to take out loans and it kind of sucks because I would love to move and get away from the environment and I'm in but there's like there's all their obstacles with that my whole family as a reason I've been trying to convince that YouTube is actually okay there's a time right now in my life everyone's on vacation everyone's out of school right now right I'm thinking about not going back to school for this fall semester meaning from August to December and they gave taking a break taking this break to focus on my channel work hard travel do whatever I can that makes me happy truly and try and make a living off of it instead of working my butt off having anxiety attacks not being able to sleep overall becoming sure at least had all because I'm trying to get a piece of paper that will make my family happy aka something that y'all didn't know is I actually wanted to take a break before going to school I wanted to take a year off and not go to college right away I wanted which would have been fun I would have started college maybe like 18 turning 19 like that's not bad at all but that would have been if I had to I wanted to that timeframe where I was gone for months my channel if you followed me for a while I was gone for months at a time in my channel and I was because I was in school I can't handle both me as a person I'm not capable of putting hours in a day at least out eight hours a day to studying and doing the homework and doing stuff like that for school and then trying to put another 15 hours into creating and editing and thinking of content for my channel I can't do that I can't do both that's not me that's not how I work when I'm dedicated on something that's the one thing I want to focus on when I was in college you guys that I was so sad I was so sad I became a person that like yes I was more free because I was not in the control of my mom and my sister but I also was unhappy because the while I was free I was trying to please still please everybody around me when I went to college my mom literally told me don't dress how you normally dress don't wear what you normally wear and tone down your makeup because when you go to school you want to fit in with everybody I was told to not be myself so I could get a piece of paper that would please other people I just I don't understand like I want so badly be able to be on my own but unfortunately even at this point in my life like if I go and I went and got like a minimum-wage job or even a job that paid me a little more than minimum wage my family would look down on me they wouldn't see me as an entrepreneur as someone who's working hard at a young age to try and get to their goals at someone as someone who's determined as someone who's actually doing something they enjoy they would not see that because I don't have a paper behind what I'm doing I don't know what to do anymore another thing as I right now if she helps me pay for my car which is great because like like I said I don't make as much as I do on YouTube I could probably make enough to pay for my car and then have maybe money for groceries afterwards but that's about as much as I have right now another issue is even though I'm still restrictive you know I can't move out right now I can't live out on my own right now as much as I want to I can't and because I have to depend on my mom right now for some help she uses that against me he says because I'm helping you with your car you can't drive it this far the other thing is it's more it's a bit more complicated than that too because like her name is on my car so if you know anything about cars like she is she does partly owned the car with me but it's just that was more for like helping me get a lower cost on the car you know that's something that I would think a parent would do because they're just trying to help their kid not hold it against them and say hey I helped you with your car so you can't do this with it I don't want you taking it here I don't want you doing this and it's like yes they're like I understand yes because you're helping me I get it I get it I do I do trust me I get that but another part of me doesn't get how you know even if I do do YouTube as full-time I've suggested it and then go get a part-time job get something else like that she will tell me no because that time I could have spent getting a part-time job and you know in my opinion it would help me be able to take everything over for myself and eventually move out because I would have two sources of income coming in and I could save up more easily she goes no you could have spent that time going to school I know I'm hurting a lot on the inside and it's a constant issue for the past two years it's been very evident it wasn't that hard growing up you know I just kind of I did get sad coming up because I was over stricted but you know I just did it and let that bother me that much like I tried to not let it bother me but it's just what do you but dealing with this risk [Music] hc' gets very tiring at times and I try with all of this I tried I try to put out good content I try to be happy my motto is to stay happy stay positive and stay coming because lord knows this world needs that I know I need it no I don't want it but this video because I feel so bad because I know my family does watch my videos and I'm sorry like it so I've been feeling and I don't want to put this part of me out onto the world so much it's not what I feel like I should be expressing but I do want to be real with y'all in terms of my feelings I don't know what to say anymore I'm trying to figure out the direction I want my channel to go work it needs to be done that needs to be done I'll see y'all in my next video	Character count: 23887 | Duration in seconds: 1668 |

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_0DCUz4Fck		My Suicide Attempt	hey guys so I have some news after my last video I was planning suicide and as you guys know I've been planning suicide for a long time now and on Christmas I attempted suicide and I just got out of Millard Wan it's kind of like a mental facility to keep you safe on Christmas I was at my friend's house and we were talking and we were drinking and after that we both went to bed and I slept in the basement and I've been making a video for a long time now and it's maybe an hour and a half long and I couldn't take it anymore and I started writing writing letters as well to a lot of my friends and family but I never got to the family because their letters would be longer than the letters to my friends and I never got to them but on Christmas day it was nighttime it was maybe midnight or 1:00 a.m. and I couldn't take it anymore it's really depressed and I just really really really wanted to go so I never finished it so I ended up making a video saying goodbye and I wrote one little letter saying that I'm sorry because my friend would find me dead in the morning um I took a meat knife and I cut my legs in my arms my forearms and my stomach I have some cuts right here and then I put a an alarm clock cord around my neck and I was going to hang myself but as I said I was drinking and I think that's what saved my life I was too drunk to hang myself but I attempted it and I passed out well I took the cord offers and I passed out from the bleeding but I was sort of still awake and so I stumbled my way up the stairs to my friends room and he was dead asleep because a heavy sleeper and I ended up knocking over a dresser with my feet my legs well I was on the ground bleeding out and that woke him up and he was he was panicky you don't know what to do and he was just screaming and he couldn't he hesitated he didn't know whether or not to pick me up in the dark or turn off the lights it took him a few seconds to actually turn on the lights and then when he turned on the lights he saw me there's blood everywhere on my arms and he said he was drinking too and he didn't know what to do he was a drunk drunk but he was drinking so I could tell he was just hesitating to stay sober to get me to the hospital and then we drove there and on the way there I opened my the car door the passenger door and I attempted to jump out and he had to pull me back in I think I was just really pissed off that I didn't worth the first time when I tried committing suicide because I was too drunk I couldn't hang myself and then we got to the hospital and they had to do a cat scan they had to check my neck because there was a huge like line going around it and I'll show you the picture right now that is my neck right there after the lion Clark clock cord was um it was wrapped twice around my neck and I went to go hang myself with it but it never worked and I will show you the cuts right now and if you don't like seeing cuts don't look but here are the cuts this is what happened that night when I did that and these are just a few hours after so they were pretty deep somewhere deeper than others but most of them were just batches because I couldn't find a razor so I used meat knife and I don't know if it was dulling out but it was pretty sharp I think I was just because I was drunk then I can go really deep and on the way to the hospital the ER my or I called my mom and I was crying you know screaming and I called my brother as well and they all met me at the hospital but only my mom could come back for some reason so they just dropped me off and told me that they loved me and then they went home just to wait what and see what would happen so I was in the ER for a few hours because we were waiting for a spot in miller devon the place i was talking about where they keep people safe and I was on a 72-hour hold and we had to wait for a spot so I was in the ER for a few hours until I was wheeled over there and I spent five days there because on a weekend weekends don't count as a 72-hour hold and my friends came and visited for a little bit and we went over what would happen after this and now I'm in ILP which is intensive outpatient therapy and it's maybe three times a week for three hours a day and I have to be in there for maybe three to six weeks we don't know yet and yeah that's pretty much what happened and being in that mental health hospital I was kind of going insane actually it's kind of ironic that place was actually making me go psycho but I learned a lot of things and there are a few people that were dealing with depression as well but when I compared myself to them and I know in the other video I told you not to compare yourself with others but with this compare myself with other people made me feel like my problem so so small compared to others and it made me happy in a way but at the same time sad because I feel bad for them so I was glad that I went to the mental health hospital to see different perspectives and now hopefully after this ILP I will be going to monthly or weekly sessions of therapy with this christian-based place but after I attempted my life I traumatized a lot of my friends in my family especially my mom and doing that makes me feel it would help with my pain in that it doesn't matter what others think it's what you feel there's still even my feelings pass on to other people and I don't I haven't really really realized that until I actually attempted suicide so I'm kind of glad that I did it in a way but at the same time I really hurt my family now I have marks all of my arms in my legs and I'm kind of ashamed being out in public and people are gonna see these and I'm not I'm not ashamed at the same time because you know this is my story I mean this is what I went through at the same time I don't want people thinking that I'm some depressed girls that is faking her smile every day besides that I don't want to go into details and everything that I learned and I saw in Miller duan the mental health hospital I want you guys to know that I am very very grateful that you guys have subscribed to me and if you haven't I'm still grateful for your mess and I'm sorry that I haven't written back to most of you I've been busy of course I've been in the hospital and I've been in therapy but I will try so hard to write you guys back so until next time I hope you guys are doing well and I hope there's some sort of way that you can cope with your depression or your anxiety whatever you may have so I'm gonna end the video now but I want you guys to know that I love you and I'm not the only one that loves you just know there's people out there to help you so don't give up if you've learned anything from this I hope that you took away that you deserve to live like I said just remember that there's someone out there that loves you and I'll talk to you guys later	Character count: 6854 | Duration in

probably a little hard on you guys um I was kind of scared to tell this story just because it was kind of recent like not recent but like within the past two years which is recent to me cuz I like I still talk to people from my high school but this did happen when I was in high school I am gonna change one major detail in the story because I don't want people to try and guess who this person is and I don't want this person to like come at me for this because it's this kind of was like a huge misunderstanding in the story like you guys will understand what I'm talking about but um this is - oh god this is the story about how I was almost raped when I was in high school I was a senior one of the most traumatizing experiences I've ever gone through in my life but I'm the reason I'm sharing the story with you guys is that hopefully by you guys seeing what kind of went wrong in this story it can help a lot of you younger ones who you know are going through your stage of hormones and you know exploring your sexual activity is something that hopefully this can help you guys and make sure that you guys stay safe when you guys are you know exploring that part of your life but before I do get started you want to say make sure you guys thumbs this video up just so that it is shared around the world and other people can watch this video this is mainly goes out to younger girls but this can also relate to boys as well but um thumbs it up and subscribe to my channel there will definitely be happier videos in the future but um I'm just going to go ahead and jump into this video okay so in the story I'm not going to use a name not gonna use a fake name if I can already see people trying to guess like oh this fake name is probably somewhere close to the real name I'm just gonna tell you guys like broad details so this story time took place my senior year of high school um I can't remember this is like how I tried to push this event like this this tragic story like in my life try to push you to the back of my head so I'm not really sure if this was first semester of my senior or second semester we're in between I feel like it was more in between it all started with this boy so now I've known this boy since freshman year of high school that's when I met him this boy was really nice um you know I never really had a thing for this boy I just always saw him as a friend and that's how it was all the way up until my senior year I was talking to this boy after school and we would talk almost every day after school for a little bit before like we would leave to go home and you know it was always just cool conversation just like what we were doing after school like what we were planning on doing for the weekend um just like kind of basic conversations but I talked to this boy a lot and I saw him that's a really close friend so one day I was walking around my school during sixth period which is the last period of the school day at my school but I didn't have a class because I had finished all my classes so I decided to not take a 6 period class so I was just walking around wandering and I ran into my friend and he was actually leaving usually get it leave till after school but he was just like telling me oh he was planning on leaving 6 period like leaving early and I was like oh what are you doing and he was like oh I'm just gonna go hang out with some friends but he was like do you want to go grab a bite after and I was like sure but like do you want me to come with you now or are you gonna pick me up after school and he was just like oh you can come with me now if you want and I was like ok why not so I get in the car keep in mind I didn't know where we were going I just knew we were hanging out with friends I was always down taking out friends so I get in the car with him and his other two friends come to the car it's two guys just these two guys I'm not going to they don't need names they're just two guys I knew from school buddy hang out with them they weren't my crowd because this the next part of the story um so we get in the car and we start driving and as we're driving I'm sitting in the front seat brother and his friends are sitting in the back we're driving and I'm just like oh where we going he's like oh we're going to a weed distributor place I don't only know what it's called but like we're going there basically going to go pick up some weed now one of his friends in the back had a marijuana card so he could legally buy weed so I guess that's what they were doing so we got there but it was like really sketchy places I don't know I did feel comfortable and I don't know but that's not you know that's not really the point of story anyways they end up picking up the weed they get in the car and they start smoking weed um they asked me if I wanted some I said no because I didn't smoke weed like that like I've tried it before but like in this time of high school I wasn't I've never been a person to just like smoke weed so I was just like no I'm good blah blah anyways we after we picked up the weed we ended up dropping off all of his friends off at their houses and then me and this boy went to a yogurt place to get some frozen yogurt so we're sitting there eating our first neighbor we actually ate it in his car and I remember we were talking and something about me like a very characteristic that I kind of wish I didn't have is that I'm a very flirty person I'm not purposely a flirt but I just am actually like overly nice to people and usually it gets me in trouble with guys that they think I'm flirting with them and I'm not really meaning to but like I said before when I started the story this guy was just a friend to me I never really saw him in that kind of romantic way anyways I could tell he was flirting with me and I knew like I was flirting with him but like I said he was a friend so I didn't really cared like if it came off as flirting I don't know I'm just I'm just a flirty type I don't really I just I don't know I never really liked I always flirt with people but nothing really ever happens with it you know you just flirt and it's just like oh that girl flirted with him before you're gonna be it's not a big deal anyways we're just chilling in his car and he was like okay you only take you home and I was like yeah like okay let's go home so I have to read the frozen yogurt we went to my house and at my house there's a park across the street from my house but like you can still see my house from the park anyways instead of driving to my house he was like oh let's drive up here real quick like I just want to see what's over here so he drives to this park you have to kind of like go up a hill to get to the park he drives to the park and we just chill in his car we're just talking there's another car at the park already and they were just chilling do you mind it's around 6 o'clock now kind of getting late outside kind of getting dark we're just chilling in his car and we're talking and then things kind of got carried away um he kissed me and guys like it this boy is not ugly this guy was actually really cute he was a friend you know I just never thought of him that way but I was just like you know what hey why not I - what like you know I wasn't it wasn't a bad thing that kissed me so we start making out and that's as far as I thought things would go like us making out you know I never really hung out with him outside of school besides talking to him after school but I never really hung out with him so we're just we just start making out and I'm thinking us as far as it's going to go considering we've never had like a real conversation like I don't even text this guy after school you know I mean so we're making out for about 10 minutes when this guy says do you want to make out in the backseat because like the way we were making out his like he had like a a console a center console and it was really huge so we're like leaning over it so it's kind of really uncomfortable so he was like do you want to go to the backseat and like make out and I was like sure like why not you know what like we're already making out why not he's a good kisser I don't mind it let's let's do it so we hop into the backseat and we start making out once again and then we stop because he asked me like if I want to give him a massage and I was like boy no I'm not about to give you a massage like you give me a massage I probably at this point sure just went home and not giving any massages or taking any massages but he starts to give me massage she's massaging my back and it doesn't really get anything crazy just massaging me and I'm laying down on his seat and he's like straddled on top of me so this is me laying down and then he's like sitting like that on top of me and he's massaging my back after of like 10 minutes he stops and he was like okay you're gonna give me a massage and I was like you know what why not I suck at massages like it took him along just to convince me to give him a massage because I literally stuck at massages but I was like you know what why not so I start giving him a massage so after about five minutes of me massaging him um he decides to flip over so like right now he's on his back and I'm on top of him Charlotte like this five minutes later he like flips himself this way so now I am like straddled on top of this boy's penis area and like yeah he leans up and he starts kissing me and we're making out and I'm basically like straddling this guy basically but like I didn't mean to put myself in this position it just that's he flipped that way and now that's what was happening when we were making out once again I didn't think I was going to go any further than us making out like I said I never really talked to this guy like that and I really flirted with him like that it was always just friendly conversation so we started making out and eventually I'm kind of getting tired of it like you know it's like when you make out with someone too long it's like okay either something's gonna happen next or it's gonna stop there so in my head I'm like it's gonna stop so I pulled him out I pull back and I'm just like okay like I think I'm gonna go home now it was like no like just stay just stay and I was like no I probably should go home I got a feeling that you might be do I tell you oh you can tell me if or wrong girl I think you might be	Character count: 10523 | Duration in seconds: 592 | Characters per second: 17.8

hard to talk about it's something I've been trying to make a video of for the past ten days and every single day failing and I hope today is the day that I have the courage to talk about this I feel I need to give a trigger warning if the mention of suicide is going to set you off a lot I have resources in the description bar please check them out if you are struggling with the idea if it's something that you've dealt with if you've lost somebody to suicide and you can't hear the mention of it please reach out to people I have resources people in your life want to help you I promise that being said I want to talk about this thing that's on my heart and in my mind constantly and it is suicide in traditional social media and TV shows suicide has recently been romanticized and it has been mentioned a lot and there's been a huge increase of teenagers that have been found in the emergency room due to suicide attempts and hearing that makes me feel like I need to share this story of what happened to me and something that has impacted my life every single day since it happened five years ago one of the people I cared about in the world the most um this is when it gets hard it took her own life this is why I haven't been able to film it this is coming from somebody that has had those thoughts somebody that has had to get a lot of help because of having those thoughts I'm not gonna tell the story of how it happened or what happened because I don't think it's fair to her and I don't think it's fair to me and I don't think it's fair to you guys but I just kind of want to sit for a little bit and talk about what it's like after what it's like leaving the people that love you behind even when you feel like nobody loves you because it sucks the way that I've described losing a friend to suicide is basically when you love somebody you give them a little piece of your heart and when people break your heart I mean you eventually get that little piece back you find that piece and you're able to kind of mend your heart but when you lose a friend to suicide especially you don't ever get that little piece back it's like this empty little hole in your heart that eats away at you forever it's always confusing and it doesn't make sense and I know how she was feeling before she took her own life because I've been in that place where I thought that was an option and I thought that was something that would make things better and I thought that would just fix all my problems and I it doesn't use everybody that you care about with so many more I guess all I can say to somebody that's contemplating any in their own life is that you can't I didn't feel like you can I know you feel like it's gonna fix everything I know from my friend I can't even imagine the amount of pain that she went through before she decided to make this decision this permanent decision that can never be taken back and I'd suck at first I didn't believe it was real I spent a lot of time convincing myself it wasn't real and it didn't happen and then for a long time I was angry because the friend that was always there for me it wasn't there for me through this they weren't even here it's like the worst heartbreak ever because it can't be fixed I know before she entered her own life she felt like nobody loved her and that nobody was going to love her it's not true when you take your own life you rob yourself of all these people in the future that want to love you and want to know you and want to be around you when you take your own life you don't even give it a chance you don't give it a chance to get better you don't give these people that are waiting for you that you haven't even met a chance to love you you don't give happiness a chance and I understand how hard it is I have been there and I've had those thoughts and I've had to get help for those thoughts and it's the hardest thing it's the hardest thing to try to convince yourself to stay alive when you feel like the only option is to end it but I promise you I absolutely promise you that it's worth it and that it does get better even if it feels like it does even if you feel like you're stuck and you're gonna feeling forever it's not true because people are just gonna miss you so much and they're gonna miss you forever I know if you're in that position that this sounds like a load of shit I know because if you would have told me when I was going through that that I would have the friends I have now and I would have this chosen family that I didn't even know could exist I wouldn't have believed you I would have thought it was a load of crap I would have thought everyone was completely bullshitting me but it's honestly so true is if you are in the position when you were so heartbroken by the world that you think you need to take your own life it means you have a heart that is so full of pain which means it can be so full of love it means that you're somebody that feels a lot and loves a lot and it's a disservice to the world to leave if you're one of those people you think that ending your own life will make things better but in reality it just makes this dark world a little bit darker when we need it your light my life was so much brighter with her in it and I still convinced myself that she's out there and that it didn't happen and that she's just quietly living a life where she's happy but she's not she's not here anymore if you feel like you can't go to your parents go to a guidance counselor go to a teacher because these people are trained to help you find better help there are so many people that have devoted their lives to trying to help other people stay alive I'm going to leave as many resources as I can and the description bar down below if you guys know of any others that are extremely helpful please send me an inbox on tumblr or tweet them to me any way you can get them to me please let me know so I can add them in if you know somebody or you are somebody that is dealing with suicidal thoughts or has attempted suicide please seek out professional help and please help those people seek out professional help because you can only help so much and these people have been trained to help people that are having these thoughts or are doing these things if you're somebody that has lost somebody to suicide my heart is with you as you can probably tell and your pain is valid and I also really encouraged people in that position to seek out professional health because it hurts a lot I promise you it gets so much better I guarantee you I swear it gets better and that life is worth living even when it feels impossible and people care about you a lot and I really hope that this suicide trend and soon because it's fucked up and it's not fair to anybody thank you for watching this all the way to the end again I've left resources in the description bar please seek help if you need it and with that I'm gonna say goodbye	Character count: 7037 | Duration in seconds: 441 | Characters per second: 16.0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4H2veOd9SA		my story with suicide.	hey guys it's Molly Albrecht and today we're back with a serious video this is not like any of the videos that I've made in the past and this is not going to be all fun and spunky like the blogs that I've been making I've already filmed this video twice and this is now my third attempt to try to film this video I'm here to spread awareness because I feel like suicide is something that people think that they need to hide and I feel like the more that people feel like they need to hide the fact that they are feeling suicidal bit more that suicide actually happens and more that people attempt and the more that people feel like they're alone so I feel like when I come here to talk about this very serious topic that more people can feel open to speak about their own experience to me or to other people around them or even come to YouTube and make their own video like I've been inspired by Sabrina trans I go to school with her and she made a video similar to this and it really inspired me to make me push through and make this video once again I don't even know where to start if you new to my channel I'm Molly Albrecht um I do makeup I'm a freelance makeup artist and I have a lot of dreams and hopes for my own future I hope to one day move to LA and to pursue doing makeup in Hollywood or come back here and pursue your makeup here in Colorado either way I want to go to school in LA and I want to pursue makeup in any way that I can so how did this all start so in elementary school I was bullied for having glasses kids would call me ugly they would call me fat so here's one pair of the glasses that I used to wear a lot of the time this I believe was the pair that I wore a lot in fourth third grade and then this pink pair here was the pair that I wore a lot in fourth grade so I was bullied a lot and elementary school and I feel like it is the main reason why I feel so down on myself still and never confident and never feel like I'm enough I feel as though it's hard it's a reason why I also have a lot of hard times making friends too as a child I have repressed memories I don't know if you guys know what that means but it means basically just like I have memories of a time and an instance that happened that you're not quite sure if it happened because it's forgotten so basically you shut it out of your mind completely and then it comes back through dreams and you think it could be a memory or it could not be a memory or it's just a continuous dream that keeps happening so that happens with me and something that people call molestation not a fun topic and not something that people are very open about either and so I remember distinctly when I was a child I remember it had started or I remember from what I can remember me asking this family member if you can get pregnant from yourself and said no and then I just everything after that was blank and I don't remember anything the other thing that I do remember is that I would get scared at night my feeling member would say hey coming to my bed and you can just hang out with me and I would be like yeah okay I get rid of whatever problem I have in my own bed and I go and I'd sleep with them and I can't I don't have a memory of ever getting inside the bed after I got inside I have no memory at all as to what happened afterwards and those memories came back around 7th grade 6th grade was the time that my dad started getting to gather with my stepmom and they started getting really super serious and I remember that that December he had proposed to my stepmom and it was also 6th grade was also the first year that I haven't ever gotten Instagram and with children in Instagram they're gonna follow whoever account they want to follow so for me I followed depressed pages and so reading through all those messages made me develop a habit of picking up a razor my first time picking up a razor was in sixth grade I was upset about something I don't remember exactly what it was but that was the first time that I had ever picked up a razor and I slit my wrists it was one of those feelings where I felt relief and like I wanted to continue and to this day I still cannot break the habit of whenever I feel sad or whenever I feel guilty or whenever I feel like I deserve it I pick up a razor so a sixth grader should not be picking up a razor I say should not be feeling like the need to pick up a razor and use it in such a way raises are only supposed to be used for shaving and that's how they're supposed to be used except for there was me six greater than me breaking apart a razor just to use it to slit my wrists and just to cut which is not okay at all and I hope to all the younglings out there who might be watching like my sister will be watching Ryan I have only two cod and if you ever if you ever feel like you're getting upset and you ever want to pick up a razor come wake me up come get me because I don't happen to you this grade was already a pretty rough year I was very antisocial all my friends have made new friends and I am very antisocial when it comes to making new friends so for me I just reverted to boys and my dad also got remarried and I was very heartbroken about that I felt like as if I had been replaced I felt like as if he had loved my stepmom more which I am well aware of that there's no such thing as loving someone more or less it's just a different type of love with everything breaking down I broke two and I started getting really depressed and that was the first time that we went to the doctor and we got prescribed medicine for being depressed and I remember I hated it because I felt like a zombie I felt like I just had one mode and that was just happiness I wouldn't really feel sympathetic or empathetic for anything it was all just zombie mode so I remember not asking my doctor not doing anything just slowly veering off myself and just immediately stopping medication because I hated the way that it made me feel so then high school rolls around losing my best friend and then going into a new school losing all those new friends that I had gotten at the time at the school and then losing pretty much everything and all hope that I had for myself and all hope that I had for my future I don't know what to do anymore I stopped to picking up makeup brushes and I said fine and I stopped going to school with makeup on it I dressed like as if I was just home alone and I just didn't care anymore I remember I remember um feeling like suicide might be an option from me in the ninth grade halfway through the year and that's when Christmas break happened and then during Christmas break all the friends that I had a connections with and all friends that I thought that I had around the school no one texted me no one hit me up during winter break used razors a lot during Christmas break I felt like during Christmas break my boyfriend went on vacation and I felt like I had nobody because he couldn't never talk so on the new years of 2017 I made my first suicide plan and I decided that I would be dead in March of 2018 I decided that I did not want to lose anyone I thought that that night I remember saying to myself this is going to be the best year ever because to me I was gonna be done suffering I was gonna be done with the struggle and to me I was gonna be done with whatever I had going on all of my confusion all of my struggles all of my stress which is gonna be gone it was just gonna be gone and I didn't have to worry about it anymore so I decided that night to text my boyfriend I decided to text him and let him know what my plan was and I fell asleep woke up to the cops at my door when the cops came I didn't know what they were going to do I know how anything worked and so when they came to me I told them blatantly everything I was like hey I have a plan for suicide I'm gonna do this this this business and then do it in March and that's just how it's gonna happen and they told me okay well my we were going to take you to the hospital and we're going to hold you there and tell a nurse can release you and so my head was like yeah I'm not leaving my freaking house I'm not leaving my house and they told me that I didn't have an option and then I had to leave so I head out the door my mom was in the room the entire time and she started crying and she was driving behind the ambulance the entire time that we were going to the hospital here in Greeley they walked me in and put me on in bed and told me changed and the nurse comes in and I again tell her everything I went to the hospital and I sat there in the waiting room crying with my mom and we just sat there holding each other and her telling me that it's just gonna be okay and that she is gonna miss me a lot and so they she had to go and what the time had to go she and me held each other's hand and I didn't tell god I held on to my mom and I told her mommy I don't want you to go please don't go please don't leave me but the thing is is that I didn't have an option she had to go and I had to go to so she left the hospital and that's when my journey had meant hospital started and again if you guys would like to hear that story I can make sure to do that in a different video just make sure to leave a comment down below and I'll try to make that video for you guys okay so we're getting out of the mental hospital I thought my life had turn around and I thought that I was gonna be another happy-go-lucky girl again and looking at it now I know that it's okay do you need help I know that it's okay and I know that it's okay to just call out to somebody and say hey I need help and I need it now I need to fix this issue that I have I know that that's okay now okay so I am back with part two my part two I mean like the second part of this since I stopped filming and I completely just forgot about the video for a hot second because he got like too sad at the moment so we are back and today we're going to finish up the story so where we left off was I was telling you about when I got at the hospital I love me I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about what exactly happened between point A and point B being now but I'm just going to tell you a few stories about the other suicide attempts that I've had the other times that I've been risky with suicide so um anyways I would play with everyone in my life like a yo-yo I'd push them away in hopes that they came back and then once they did come back I'd push them back away which is no que to do and I'm still working on it I'm still working on a lot of things actually so aside from that I attempted suicide about three other times I remember I would get so depressed in class sometimes that I would just stare at a wall for an hour straight and not move my eyes not move anything I would just sit and stare at a wall and cry and I would just be a zombie I'd be dead inside and that's how I felt like I was I felt like I was already dead I felt like I had already past due time that I was supposed to be alive because at the time is the last March and I already passed the time that I felt like I needed to be dead so with this um I would just stare at a wall and then I'd asked to go to the bathroom sometimes and on occasions I there was at least five instances that I can recall that I was just walking through the hallways thinking this is my last time ever seeing this school this is my last time that I'm ever going to appreciate the way that buildings are made people smiling it was gonna be the last time I saw anything and I just think we remember walking through the hallways and just looking around me and saying wow this world is so beautiful because to me I was just trying to appreciate it for the last time so along with this I one time thought it was going to be my last time again I went around the school and I place notes everywhere that said I'm sorry or that said I hope you'll accept that I'm gone or I'm it's okay or saying things along the lines of I'm going to be gone and it's going to be okay I'm sorry I took these messages and I placed them around the school and then afterwards we have a train track right behind her school and also that day right after I was done littering the floor with papers I walked around to the back of my school and I sat down behind the school and I texted all my family members that I was sorry I texted some friends some old friends telling them that I was sorry because in my head I was going to do it I looked to the side of me and I looked in front of me and I saw a plastic bag swinging around in the grass I picked it up and I started to put it around my neck and took myself with it until I couldn't breathe in my head was going up it took too much effort and the string was not as hard to pull it was extremely hard to pull and it was extremely hard to get around my entire neck to pull hard enough to actually strangle myself so I decided that that plan wasn't working as well and so I got up and I walked over to the train tracks behind my school and I laid there I ended up laying there for a while and I ended up realizing that a train wasn't coming so I figured hey maybe this is some force of nature telling me that today is not the day so I got up and without a second thought I left my school I ditched my last two periods and I left and walked my happy butt over to my middle school to see my middle school teachers because I felt like they were gonna be the ones that were gonna make me happy again and luckily they did make me happy so shout out to my favorite two teachers um I'm in middle school you guys helped me a lot that day to feel better and I just want to thank you guys cuz it meant a lot to me that you guys were there one time I was in school and in Spanish class it was really bad I asked to use the Hall Pass and use the restroom the Hall Pass was on lanyard and it had a little hall pass string attached to it so I went to the bathroom and there was a bar that was strung across and I decided to take this lanyard tie it up onto the bar and try to get up into it so that I could hang myself in the bathroom I jumped up and I got the string around the bar and I started to pull it to where I couldn't pull it down any farther and then I tried to hop up onto the toilet seat so that I can get up into it into the lanyard and I ended up since I am only 5 1 not being able to reach that and I ended up having to get back down calm down and go back to class the next attempt and this night I went into one of my my attacks I guess you could say where these attacks I completely start laughing and I can't stop laughing [Music] [Music] because all I'm thinking about it's just solely death I just don't know what I said I'm just excited so I went into another panic attack and I was laughing and I was crying at the same time just saying I'm going to hang from my ceiling and that was what I wanted to do I went and I took a scarf I tie it to my ceiling and I got up to it and then I stepped it back down and I call him calmed the freak out and I went to sleep when I woke up in the morning everything was fine and I ended up being two days later I found out something that was making me happy again and so now we're here the most important thing is that I am still here which means that you are still here with me and I just wanted to reach out to all of you guys out there and just say thank you for being strong no matter what you're going through no matter what you have gone through no matter what you're going to go through keep moving forward and keep living it's such a beautiful world out here whether it seems like it at the moment or not I am Alive tonight and that is what really matters um I'm not dead I would never died in March I'm very much alive I'm very much still here and that's the really important part and I want to further this message to convey to anybody who's feeling depressed or anything that's feeling suicidal to know that there is no such thing as no out there's always an out and then out is never ever suicide that out is never cutting and that out is never any type of self-harm or any type of anything there's always someone that wants and cares for you so never ever feel like nobody wants you or nobody cares about you because it's absolutely not the truth whether I know you or not I definitely care about you the important thing is that I got through it which means that you can get through it no matter what you're going through no matter how hard it is and no matter how many times that you feel like the only out that you have is self-harm and anyway with eating or with personal and physical damage or anything like that it's never an out and definitely suicide is never ever ever an out it's never an out and it's never it needs to be an out that and it is okay to reach out to those people around you and let them know hey I'm not okay and this is why and I'm not okay and if you can even if you don't know why because I have the time that I'm upset I don't even know why it's okay to say I'm upset and I have no freaking clue how I don't know how I'm upset and I don't know why I'm upset but I just am and I need something to help me that is okay and it needs to be okay so no matter what you are no matter where you are no matter how hard you feel like it is to stay alive it will always get better the more that you work towards wanting to have that successful future and the more that you work towards being okay with the world and being okay with yourself the more that you will be able to have the great experience of living in this beautiful gorgeous and yet really horrible life so if you guys are

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUJfClMp4I4		I've Tried To Kill Myself	[Music] all right so I pretty much just turned on my camera I'm not gonna really try to edit this video too much because I feel like it's more something that should come from the heart and not be a cookie cutter and all that so I'm gonna try to cut it down on the editing alright so um I'm just gonna start this video off by saying I've tried to film this video at least 20 times in this past year and I've never I've done it I filmed the whole video I spent hours filming the video and trying to edit it to my liking but I've never I never finished it I never I never felt that it's good enough for you guys to see so today's the day where I'm gonna film this video and get it all to you guys and hopefully help you guys and get you to help you to know who I am alright so my name is Johnny I'm 17 I've been suicidal and depressed since I was about 9 I can't really remember what year this happened for some reason and I don't really feel like looking it up so don't judge me and make fun of me for this but my dad passed away I think in 2011 I'm not totally sure I'm sorry and he first got cancer and we thought it was gonna be fine everyone was telling us it's gonna be fine it's not that bad and then it randomly just went to stage 4 and then he randomly um just passed away one night and I woke up to firemen and people inside my house carrying my dad out and my sister just crying on me and my brother just trying to hold me down I've never even accepted it I don't know I don't know if the hardest part for me is that I don't feel like I can remember my dad I know really um I just feel like I'm just I don't know I just haven't alright um so after he passed away I was already having a lot of issues in school and stuff because I'm Dyslexic and I never wanted to do anything that's school hot for me like to offer I've always wanted to either do entertainment or music and I would get bullied a lot because I used to dress really weird I used to wear hats and skinny jeans and all and look how I look like pretty much today so I get bullied a lot so I would after my dad passed away I would go to therapy and stuff for about four maybe three years I don't I think three years and I would have to go pretty much once every three days or something like that and it was pretty miserable because they would always have to like check my weight and stuff because they thought I was too skinny and then I'd feel bad about myself and I feel like I'm not gaining weight I'm not eating healthy enough I'm too skinny and there was just a lot of bad things happening that year those years it was like about four years that was really depressed I went to I think three institutions for like a week each and one was really scary one I had a stay there and it was like actually crazy people and they're like no offense to crazy people but they're people that were you know little loony and I actually got thrown in there I got thrown in thought I was gonna get killed by a guy for no fucking reason which was really scary and I think that guy was my roommate if I can remember it was really fucking scary and I remember talk to my mom and being like I need to get the fuck out of here because they're some guy that wants to kick my ass and then next thing I know he got kicked out because I told the people so I was safe I think I'm fine now but that was really scary that scared the shit out of me and I think I was there for you cuz I was so depressed that I wanted to kill myself and um I don't know I think I I remember when I was there I would um want to uh get out and then just kill myself like right the day I got out I was just like I'm gonna kill myself and there are many like times where I tried to I I would just I just remember I'm sitting on my house like the roof of it and just thinking and just wanting to jump off like and just fucking end it but for some reason I did it because I felt there was a little light at the end of this road like there was just a reason for me to keep on pushing even though my life was feeling like complete and utter crap and I didn't think I didn't think anything would get better I don't feel like I'm gonna get too much into my past right now um I don't know why one I can't really remember it right now I'm overwhelmed which happens to me a lot I always forget my past which is kind of weird but yeah I just I was just I was really mean I was just a bad kid back then I was really misunderstood and I treated my family like crap and I treated a lot of things like crap and I just had a lot of bad things happen and I don't really feel like getting into those right now yeah so suicide and all that and cutting it fucking sucks guys it's it's the worst pain ever it's um there's there's no light it feels like there's no there's no getting better and that's the worst is that you feel like stuck you feel like you're never gonna get out of this right and you're never gonna live your dream you're never gonna at least be somewhat happy and that's just it feels so real that if that's that's your reality that you're never gonna get better and you're never gonna feel happy and you're ever gonna be able to live your life and do the things you want to do I remember when I was suicidal that's exactly what I thought I thought there's no turning back there's no better days every day was hell and I just wanted to end it and god I can't fucking think but I don't know if for some reason I just kept on going and I kept on having a dream that my happiness would come and that I would be able to do the things I want and be able to live happily and you know be happy with my family and all that and now my life's pretty good now I'm mostly happy I still pretty much every day they'll get really depressed and at least twice or something a week I want to die but but trust me that's a lot better than how it was because I used to cry every day and I used to try to hurt myself every day because I was depressed so it's definitely improving so I'm feeling a lot better and I'm just doing YouTube and all this and having people support you and just love you and all that is really helping me a lot to you I've always wanted to do YouTube and I've been given this opportunity to reach out to thousands of people and help them and have them help me which is amazing so and I've been able to experience things that I've never drunk kind of like going on Warped Tour and stuff like that so it's crazy so what I'm pretty much trying to say is life can get better it's not gonna be 100% amazing and cookie cutter and just beautiful we only have one life and I think we should all try to live it and try to live it to its fullest even though it's extremely hard and even though people won't get you and people will make fun of you and you'll have your terrible days you'll feel sick you'll not like the way you look which trust me I don't like the way I look at all I have actually really bad skin well recently I've had pretty much this past year like pretty bad skin a lot of acne and stuff like that but I'm super insecure about especially since I'm you know feeling like I need to be perfect especially in front of the camera which which sucks a lot you know I'll make a video and then I'll regret it and I'll take a photo and then I'll regret it because I'll be like I look ugly I said the wrong thing I didn't like how I edited it or something like all those thoughts I'll just I'll hate it and I'll beat myself up for it and I'll be like and then I'll look in the past and I'll just be like I fucking hate myself back then in it it's really hard not to but yeah life can get better guys um you know life's a wave it's really hard and you know when you go down on a wave and you're you know stuck there you know it's just super hard to get back up and ride the wave again so you know you just got to keep pushing through it and good things will come even though it feels like they haven't come and even though it feels like you've been trying for so long and nothing's getting better and there's no improvement if you keep on trying I truly believe that you'll have a life that's worth living and it won't be perfect but it will be a life that you would want to live so I I just hope that this helps I'm sorry I didn't really talk to you and Depp about anything but I tried my best I do I I don't know it's just I don't know this is a step hopefully I'll post this video because I filmed this video at least 20 times I never posted it so yeah I don't know it's just really hard but it's worth living and I love you guys and I want you to all stay really strong because you're you're perfect you're beautiful well thanks for watching guys be sure to comment some supportive things to each other and take care of each other and just know that you're loved and know that it will get better just please believe in yourself and don't end today don't end your life please for god sake like don't do that it's just it's not the choice you want to do you don't want to do that you really don't it's um it will be the biggest regret of your life like that so just keep on trucking and you'll push through it and I believe in you and if you're watching this video and you're holding back from cutting and all that I just want to say I'm really proud of you thank you guys I hope I can make another one of these videos and make it better because I already feel like oh I didn't make it perfect I didn't make it good enough but I hope it helps you and I love you guys so much [Music]	Character count: 9508 | Duration in seconds: 740 | Characters per second: 12.8

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuwWpNr3_3M		I feel depressed.	oh boy it's Sunday yes it's Sunday and I'm very tired right now it's 10 o'clock 10:05 actually in the p.m. and you know I had a relatively good day but at the same time I'm in another one of my downloads I feel hopeless again I don't know why I just really feel like I'm not doing it and it may just be the tiredness talking but I feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel and I feel like the more I try the less success I feel like I'm getting ever since my mom's come home with my dad she's been in control of what I eat and I thought that would be a good thing but sadly now I don't know what I'm eating and I'm not comfortable not knowing I'm not comfortable I like my calorie counting system that I had because I knew what I was getting and I knew what I was doing and now I'm not in control of it and I'm getting ticked off so my mom makes the foods that she knows I like but the problem with the foods she knows I like is that they're not exactly the foods I need to eat and they're not exactly the healthiest you have this casserole it's a little beautiful my favorite castle it's my favorite food it's a comfort food and thing about comfort foods is they're very high in calories what it is is it's two cans of cheddar soup two cans of cream of chicken soup like crave cheddar cream of chicken six chicken breasts cut up two cans of rice and this is a double batch of course two cans of rice do you put potato chips on top as like a crust and you cover that in cheese I love it I do it tastes it's amazing but I overeat it and I can't even control myself when it comes to that I have no control over anything right now I can't control what I'm eating I can't control myself from how much I eat I can't control my weight I was doing so well and now I feel hopeless and um I've been looking through my videos and I think my highest views is eight eight views is my highest and that's okay I'm okay with that but I feel like I'm not really talking to anybody and I'm feeling like no one's there for me and it's hard for me to stay motivated trying to keep myself more of it by doing this but I don't know if I can do it if no one else supports me um I'm just scared I want to go to university and I want to have this great student life where I am suave and I get work done and you know be successful but the way I look no one takes me seriously and I don't know what to do and this is one of my few I'm depressed episodes I don't have depression I don't suffer from anything I'm just depressed right now and I don't know if there's anything I can do - no I need to talk to my mom I need to tell her straight to her face mom I love that you're cooking and I love that you're enjoying that you're cooking again but can you please cook food for me with me in mind because you'll find ways to justify it like today she said oh but there's lots of protein in there that's fine but if you could give me the protein in a way that doesn't help me gain weight I broke my rule and I checked in on my weight today and I'm back up at 328 I've gained three pounds um that's not right and I'm getting very frustrated at that um because I lost 20 pounds in two weeks if you remember that and now we're just over a month in I'm starting to gain again and I'm royally pissed and today is the day after I post this video so I guess tomorrow will be the day that I post on Facebook that I'm doing this and I'm going to get probably one more viewer but at least the people who see it will know what I'm doing they'll see what I'm doing and maybe lend a hand I've been asking on my videos if someone would make a comment to let me know that you're out there apparently not and I'm sorry I don't mean to be this guy but in a way I need to um but I'm going to go to sleep and I'm going to think happy thoughts when I wake up tomorrow I'm gonna start over again and I'm going to Regt myself again so I can keep myself sane and I can keep myself living losing weight looks right now I'm not in a good place anyways I need to heartily thank you for watching today some of these more depressing videos are no harder to look through but these are the realities of what I'm feeling and no it's not glamorous and I'm not always the happy guy that people see at school this is my other side this is the side that comes out when I feel like my back's to a wall so with that in mind have a good night slaughter and I hope to see you tomorrow	Character count: 4424 | Duration in seconds: 557 | Characters per second: 7.9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBQWlUpilKs		I'm So Depressed (Can You Relate To This Video?)	first of all I want to apologize to each and every single one of you that subscribes to authentic mental health and who is watching this video I right now so depressed I feel just terrible and in this video I just want to explain how I feel I just want to be real I just want to be open and I just want to be honest I'm sick of feeling like this and I think this video in a very strange messed-up way can help some of you that are watching this I don't know many of you can relate to this video I'm sure many of you feel how I'm about to tell you how I feel so for those of you that are subscribed to my other channel you will already know this but for the people that are I'll explain to you a bit about what happened this weekend so this weekend I took my girlfriend and my grandma away for a weekend you know just to get a break I wanted to treat my grandma and my girlfriend I didn't want to leave my grandma at home had fantastic time stayed in a fantastic hotel and it was just you know a perfect weekend couldn't have been better really and I got home a couple of hours go and I just you know broke down I it's difficult for me to even begin to tell you how I'm feeling right now first of all I feel ashamed and I know that's a bad thing I feel ashamed that I feel this way and although it is not nothing to be ashamed of feeling this way I just feel ashamed everyone always says you shouldn't be ashamed to be depressed or anxious or suffer from a mental illness and I say that myself I've said that on many videos you shouldn't be ashamed but you can't help but feel ashamed you can you I feel ashamed I feel like nobody can relate to me I feel like nobody understands why I feel this way I feel like I've let everybody down first of all I feel like I've let you down I feel like I've let everybody on this channel down feeling this way I just feel like I should be not a role model because that's not that's not how I see myself and this channel I just feel that when you watch me you come to me to be feel comfortable and relate to me but not just that but I want to feel like I'm helping you and when I make a video like this it makes me ashamed because I'm not really helping you am i I'm just expressing how I feel and I don't want to push my feelings onto you so once again I'm so sorry I feel like I've let my girlfriend down you know I love make so much with everything and she means the world to me but I feel like I can't give her the life that she deserves she deserves to travel the world have a happy life have Ferrari cars and Lamborghinis many massive houses although money isn't everything that's how much I think that she deserves because she's fantastic and when I feel like this I can't I can't give her what she wants so I feel you know ashamed and guilty and let her down feel like I've let my family down I feel as if you know I have a fantastic life you know I have everyone around me that loves me all my family they look and care for me I just and when I feel like this I feel like I've let them down and I feel like I'm a failure in life I feel like I'm a failure because I feel this way and I don't know I don't have any answers as to you know to stop feeling this way I mean it's difficult for me to look at the camera because I feel better shame that I don't really want to look into your eyes even though I can't see you but you can see me and I just I just feel totally devastated and ashamed I just there's just no words I just can't express how sorry I am to to all of you I'm scared of dying but on the other hand I feel like you know if I died nobody would miss me maybe it's for the best I won't feel like this anymore I'll be up in heaven hopefully if God accepts me up there and I won't be feeling this way anymore you know it's difficult because I am scared of dying I of course I don't want to die it scares the out of me dying I think about it 24/7 I just can't get the thought of it out of my head he's just running through my head 24/7 it just drives me insane but you know I feel like maybe it's the best thing to happen not just for me but for everyone I've let down I feel like they'll be better off without me I can't stop smoking I went like a month without smoking and I've gone back to smoking because I just it just gives me you know I know it's the wrong thing to do and it's it's a horrible habit it's disgusting it makes me feel crap it makes me feel worse it's killing me but you know when I go outside for that three four minutes of just peace and calm and quiet you know it my brain doesn't feel so jumbled and messed up but I just I'm really at a loss right now I just feel a mess if I'm totally honest with you I really didn't want to make this video I didn't want to show anybody how I'm feeling on camera like this it's I feel ashamed again and I'm so sorry I just I'm not doing this for attention before people start coming in in the comment section saying you're doing this for attention you want attention you know just shut the up people like that because nobody feeling this way needs that in their life and also for the other people that say you know snap out of it you know come on just stop feeling depressed just shut the up too because you don't want to talk about your talking like the crap you just you can't just snap out of it like that and you know people who suffer and watching this you'll know exactly what I'm on about you can't just snap out of it if wanted to snap out of it don't you think I would would have done that by now instead of just feeling like you know how I feel right now I feel like people are walking over me and they're just spitting on me that's how low I feel and think about myself like look at my top it's like ripped and I don't even care like I'm on camera this going on YouTube people are gonna watch it like I literally do not care right now about what people will say or think about me because you know I feel ashamed of feeling this way of course I do but there is no shame feeling this way and I feel so sick it's just horrendous there's no shame feeling this way and like I said at the start of the video I just want you guys and girls who support me and I subscribed to authentic mental health to understand what I am going through I want well I know many of you can relate to this video so hopefully some of you find it helpful you might not feel like you're alone anymore because right now I feel alone I just feel terrible I feel like I'm in a hole and it's just going down and happening down and saw your bearing on top of me that's how it feel and I know some of you won't be feeling like that too so hopefully you don't feel alone I'm sorry I'm rabbiting on and rambling on and this is a boring video and none of you probably care or want to watch this anyway so once again I'm so sorry that I've made this video I don't want to make any of you more depressed or make you feel I can't feelings so please just you know these selves don't let anybody tell you how to live your life you just be you be you and yeah that's all I've got to say I'm sorry for making this video and that will be now I hope you can understand why I've made this video so take care look after yourselves and hopefully I'll see you soon	Character count: 7237 | Duration

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmrM2MmFs28		My Story | Anxiety, Depression, Feeling Alone | Jaleesa Moses	hey guys so yeah I come to you with a heavy heart I guess I've been doing this for a really long time YouTube and and the whole the whole thing and I've been avoiding this subject for the longest time only because I was waiting for a time where I would either be stronger or where I thought it would be easier at some points I just thought maybe it just wasn't necessary and you know to show every part of me if that makes sense and I don't know today I kind of had kind of like a Stoke of inspiration if you will or I just felt like it was necessary like a lot of things like cutting my hair or you know showing you know a vulnerable side of me if that makes sense and so I'm a very emotional person and I will probably cry during this entire thing but I think it's important to share where I come from and to show other girls like me that up anything is possible and you know you do anything you set your mind to so anywho um I'll start with I'll start with my childhood so um I was born in New Jersey - I don't wanna call them immigrant family it sounds crazy but yeah my entire family is from Jamaica and so they blow over here years ago and I'm first-generation America American so I was born in New Jersey but I didn't live there I my family well yeah my family lives they lived in New York and so we after I was born interesting moved back to New York to live with my dad and my mom of course some baby I don't have a choice and so that was you know that was that's where I grew up for a bit of my childhood after that I ended up moving with my mom to Delaware my dad never came he stayed in New York can't say I blame him but that that might be a factor as to how I am and why I am the way I am today so anyway move to Delaware with my mom and her new job that was probably where things got the toughest for me at six years old I spent a lot of time alone a lot of time alone and I then started to kind of get into more creative things like drawing and reading and I became very independent because I had to be I learned to cook to clean to do my hair to dress myself to do everything if you've ever watched the movie Matilda besides the leak the obvious superpowers and the siblings and you know the III was Matilda so I did everything alone and you start to gain a sense of Independence and at the same time you start to become very untrustworthy you start to you know be become very comfortable in your aloneness so it was very hard I would say to make friends and have meaningful connections with people because I didn't know that you know um I didn't have any siblings and I didn't really it wasn't very very close to my family and so when it you know when I started school I was that awkward child that didn't know how to have friends that are creative kid that was always drawing I was very quiet extremely shy it was terrified to talk to anyone to the lunch lady I couldn't order my lunch I couldn't do a lot of normal things because I was scared um I was really scared I was always scared that my mom would leave me I was very scared if you alone I thought I was chopped it um she didn't look like anyone in my family it was just it's not a good space for a child growing up and you know kind of developing their ideas of the world and how they see it and how I thought it was just a scary place and don't trust anyone and don't you know so don't that's literally my don't don't do this don't do that you'll fail you'll you know that's not what you're much to do and and Brown girls are about to succeeded we're not smart and all of that type of stuff that you learn at a young age and by the time I got to high school I started to realize that okay maybe there's something in this and in this aloneness and you know I started to get friends and you know make real connections with people after I started to realize that they're not as scary as I thought they were and people aren't trying to hurt me and it's okay too to trust other people and so yeah I started to get you know my friends and I started actually taking art classes and things like that and kind of trying to see what it is that I want to do with my life because when I was younger I always thought I would be a lawyer and I still I still almost regret it not doing it because I just have a passion for research and in law and helping people and and all that kind of thing and so anyhow that's when I started to realize okay I am different and that's all right you know um after high school and in mind you I I was the kind of kid where I I didn't do not say I didn't do well in high school but I didn't think it was important and I still sorry and all the high school it was out there and maybe you shouldn't listen to me but it wasn't that important um I kind of skim by I got a trouble a lot I was suspended often just for I wasn't a violent kid but I I was very opinionated and I had a lot of opinions about a lot of different things and I would let my teachers know it and so I'd get kicked out often I'd be suspended out of school suspension in-school suspension I I was pretty much an average student I didn't do any of the homework I didn't believe in homework I couldn't concentrate on my homework and but I did very well on the tests because I kind of did that outside research and I kind of I really paid attention while I was in class I just didn't want to carry that on once I left class you know and so because I have a really great selective memory I would I would do really well on tests and so I think that's the only way that's the only reason I graduated high school is because of that I have a great guesser and I guessed my way through high school and when it came to college it was really hard to go to some of the better colleges that I wanted to go to because because I did kind of just slide by the under the radar and I didn't have an advisor I didn't have a counselor I didn't have any of those things but kind of just did all on my own somehow I don't know how and so I ended up going to an art school in Pennsylvania the Art Institute of Philadelphia which was one of the greatest things I think I ever did for myself because I don't know I'm crying about this school oh because it was kind of the first time it really got to UM express myself that's helped judgment because everybody there was unique everyone there was creative everyone there had a story and it's not like for the first time in my life I really fit it and I was devastated when I had to leave because I couldn't afford the tuition on my own and that's basically how I got through college I did it on my own I didn't have you know my parents couldn't cosign for me I didn't have family that could cosign for me I had no help and so I spent a lot of my time taking off of college semester here semester there just so I could pay for school I could work and pay for school because I always believed in education and they think it's extremely important to stay educated and informed about the things that you're interested in and everything else to be honest and so uh I worked my way through college and I ended up going to the University of Delaware because it was inexpensive it was close to home where my mother was and I could stay home and go to class and work in the meantime and so I went school full time I was always full-time and I worked part-time and then I started to do YouTube and so it it took a lot out of me physically and mentally but uh-huh it was one of those things where I just felt like I to do it I had to do YouTube if there was one person that was either motivated or inspired or learned something from me I thought it was important and they didn't want to stop that um so back to back to the University of Delaware yeah I graduated with a fine art it's fine arts degree and I have a concentration in painting I when I started I thought I would be an illustrator or a graphic designer and that I'm not good at you know sometimes you have to understand that although you love something anger ya know and so yeah I graduated with that degree and I kept thinking to myself during my last semester what am I going to do with my life am I going to you know am I gonna be a graphic designer I'm not that good at it am I gonna work for a museum I would love that what else you know I I just kept thinking what am I gonna do what am I gonna do what am I gonna do and a couple I would say maybe a year prior to that I had spoken to Cory who's my manager now a tipsy and you know he was asking me to come to California and to work with them and I was still in school and I thought it was really important not to leave because what is you know what am I saying to to all the little girls that look up to me and what am I saying if I leave college to pursue something like that something in beauty and I guess at the time I didn't realize how important it was to have a platform and to just show representation uh you know representation is so important ad when you see someone that you can relate to or that you connect with that house similar story to you and when you see them doing all the things that maybe you wish you could do well that you want to do woman when you kind of just see them you know succeed in their own way I think it's important to know it you can do that too and to say I didn't have a lot of representation or didn't have a lot of mentoring but I kind of didn't I didn't really have anyone to talk to you about these things or to give me advice you know on which way to go and how to go about it and I kind of just went inward with it and I became really really sad and lonely and stressed out and I just felt like okay I don't want to do any of this anymore I don't want to do anything anymore because what is my purpose why am I here you know and it got it got really really bad I became very depressed and I've always been really depressed that's not new but I think I became depressed in a new way in a way that I wasn't able to dig myself out of it and there were days where I would just sit in my you know in my apartment or wherever I was and I would just sleep all day I would just I would wake up I would say oh my gosh can the day be over and I would go to sleep and I would wake up around 4:00 and maybe eat something and go back to bed and then I would wake up around 8:00 and like oh my god why is this date still and and it happened every single day to the point where it was extremely unhealthy I wasn't eating well I wasn't you know socializing I wouldn't leave my apartment I wouldn't go out and do things because I was terrified and I also didn't have anyone to do these things with and maybe part of it was I didn't want anyone to do these things with I you know it's I've always been terrified to do you know to kind of uh you know I don't know put my faith in other people or trust people or I don't know I don't know and so I decided that I was going to get help for it I was going to try to get myself out of that and I started journaling and that helped me tremendously just to write down everything I was feeling and to go back and reread and and kind of see the progress and how how writing can you know take writing can can list all of those negative things and positive things outside of you and and you start to really see your thought process and and you learn from yourself but that's you know you can't you it you can't do just that you can't just journal you can't just write you can't just read you know you do need to talk to someone sometime and I started talking more with my family and calling them and tell them look I feel really alone or I'm really sad or you know they would help you through in a lot of the time like it's about time still I feel like I sometimes I just want to give up and then I want to quit let it go back home and I want to you know be with my family I'm gonna be with my friends I want to be you know I want to be under the radar I don't want people judging me and I don't want to be vulnerable just so that all that sort of thing and I never did because like I said if there there's even one person so they could help promote if he was inspired that I'm doing doing my job and that means more to me than anything else is to know that I've helped someone in a dark place be able to kind of see the light and understand that there is hope and that it will always be so sad he won't always be sad I I always I always look back to uh low light on the life of Pablo but it always makes me cry because you know when you listen to it and she says you know you won't always be sad you won't always feel so so blue and things will get better and they will and if you work towards that and you which I try your hardest you can do anything you want to and so I just wanted to tell you guys about this I didn't want to

gone down the drink I feel like I've spun out of control and I can't do anything about it you know I'm going I don't know where I'm going with this I feel like I just need to talk and then a lot of words will come out first we're not gonna address how childish my room is I am a kid at heart so whatever second I really want to die and here and let me tell you why it all started senior year of high school I don't know why I've been so depressed okay I think maybe it's just the transition into adulthood or like I don't know my entire life I've been controlled up and down by my parents I've never been able to make decisions for myself so you know sad to say and kind of I don't even know like boo but like codependent like you know I was very dependent on my parents and I cared what they thought I cared what they would think about what I would be doing and especially when it came to becoming an adult and going to college and they had all these high expectations for me at first I had everything together like I was like I'm going to college I got accepted into Penn State like this is great whatever but when I needed help nobody nobody helped me okay and not saying like I wanted it right here right now I wanted out but like when I needed to help and I was open to actually starting out everything nobody went to hell me and I just like I got here I got here I'm here you guys are being proud of me to my face telling me that everything's gonna be fine but you're not doing anything to help me I ended up not being able to go not being able to go because you know anyway sorry you know not being able to go because money problems no look I just felt like nobody would help me okay but the thing is I put myself there you want to know why because this dumbass never asked anybody else other than my unreliable parents for help okay I don't know if you guys can hear that but annoying a lot of people that I knew try to reach out I wouldn't say a lot of people my best friend's family was very is still is actually very kind to me and they've offered to help me on multiple occasions why like where are they coming from like that okay I think it's gone that they were very kind and they were all you know you know if you ever need help come to me we know how to help you dog cuz my best friend Artie is in college and she's you know figuring out her life and I'm just here not asking for help and that's the thing like a lot of people have so much pride like right now I came to the conclusion like why am I like not asking these people who have offered me help for help the reason why I was so stagnant and not asking for help it was because I found myself so deep in like I wouldn't say negative emotion like you know the whole time I've been motivating myself like telling myself I can do this I can get through this like you know trying to be an to mist which is something I'm not very good at but I've been trying and it's helped a lot you know to boost my confidence and to motivate me to actually put my foot forward and get this on the boat you know what I'm saying where was I at what was they even talking about oh I was in like such a deep dark place and I laid myself constantly um like well my friends would be like oh we're going out like do you want to come spend the night or like do you want to hang out do you want to go somewhere I would get my ass up and I would go because I knew it would be good for me to go even if like not saying I didn't want to because I did but you know the in that emotion like it's just there's no motivation to do anything I had no motivation to do anything but I was still taking steps towards to what I wanted to achieve and what I wanted to do it's just I would have been better off asking for help instead of trying to do everything for myself do not be scared to ask for help I know it's kind of like you don't want to like I was in a position where I didn't want to bother these people with my problems like I hated my mom I hated my dad my parents suck my brother was fake everybody in this house was out to get me I mean that's just how I felt I mean that's still how I feel kind of distance myself for my family but I've also done since distanced myself for my friends but I didn't want that I wanted to get closer to my friends and you know just worry about myself and where I'm going in life and what I'm doing him instead like I just like I don't even know I went into this dark ass place and then on top of that that I'm going through okay I was so fearful to take things head-on like struggles like I would just run from it how do I explain this hmm I was afraid to face things with him I loved life um major things that I knew that was going on that I needed to face but instead I just was like no I'm gonna let it rock out and just emotionally abuse myself the whole entire time and hopefully I won't be depressed by the end of it but here we are here we are okay I'm sitting in my bedroom making a video um for no reason no reason at all because I don't have anybody to talk to so embarrassing okay now another reason that I was very stagnant and stuck other than me being a dumbass and just like not doing anything like hoping for the best but not taking steps to do it like um I would say I wasn't really sure what I even wanted to do to begin with I have a lot of like passionate the a oh my okay first of all my hands are little grubby nasty disgusting worms I had a lot of passions that I wanted to pursue even as just as hobbies like I don't know like a singing writing like those are very large passions of mine and especially writing because I was good at it and the only reason No I sound so cocky the only reason why I say that is because junior high school I wrote this play and it got performed in my local theater and I was just like that's so great like that's something you're good at okay check but I had also dreams of becoming a structural engineer a civil engineer I wanted to be a nurse I wanted to be a surgeon like there was just so many things that I wanted to do and I took a lot of my high school career to try to figure that out and it didn't happen I at the end of high school I had no idea where I was going what I was doing what I was gonna become where I was set up a foundation for myself I had no idea what the to do and that took me to a very dark place especially seeing everybody else around me you know even though they were struggling as well like I'm not saying that everybody was just hooting and hollering around me having a good ass time with their life like people were struggling but like I felt like the world was in my face but at the end of the day it was all caused by me deuteron saying like it's like you know okay I live in a neighborhood that just can't stop being what it is okay so the sirens stick with it oh I would sit here and I'd be like oh my god like I'm in this position because my mom treats me the way that I am I'm in this position because I don't have any money which I mean money does play a really big role in a lot of you know what I'm saying but you know there's boys work around that so that's my point like I had ways to work around the money problem at the end of the day the only person I can really blame is myself because I never took the time to get the help I thought I could just do it all on my own like that you're 19 years old you have no life experience um your parents never taught you anything about life other than how to survive as in like the streets I don't mean like like selling drugs and like dooms right but like just how to survive living paycheck to paycheck like no I'm saying like I was thinking like that but in reality all I had to really do was think bigger for myself and just go after those goals and really take the steps to go after that but instead I was just sitting here like oh I'm gonna hope for the best and hope this dream comes me even though I'm not doing any thing about it you know so yeah I came to that realization last night at 3 o'clock in the morning and I just feel like I needed to sit down and maybe make a video and then watch it for my self and really take it all in because I'm talking to myself do you know what I'm saying I'm talking to myself I just really like want to die but I wanted to die since high school and that had nothing to do with like my career in like going into a dog hood you know I was I struggled a lot with my sexuality but at the end of the day we figured out we love women I struggle a lot with my sexuality I struggled a lot with who I was I didn't know who I was because I let other people take control of my life instead of stepping in and taking control of it myself so that feels good oh that feels good I needed to like cuss myself out okay I'm probably gonna post this on YouTube because I didn't sit here and make a video for no reason so hi um I don't even know if I'm gonna ever continue to make videos	Character

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHGPGr6bagg		I want to die	hey everybody how are you guys doing I wanted to I guess make a video of how I'm kind of feeling right now because I'm feeling absolutely useless as a person and I not sure exactly how to explain how I I really feel but if I was to be a hip or hit by bus all right now I would be perfectly okay with that and I got my hands are falling it's freaking pathetic so I been to watching some TV and I don't know it just smacked me across the face as most feeling usually dude there's no real reason for it you know the movie that I was watching was happy and everything and then it ended up that there's just this moment in the movie where it's kind of like yeah God definitely what I would have really had and it's something that I don't think that I will ever ever get because my mental status is so far off and I think it's it's not necessarily I mean it was a relationship kind of movie okay but I mean it wasn't it's not all that though it's kind of like what I'm contributing nothing at all and by me putting myself out here explaining to everybody what's going on I'm putting myself out here for a world of hurt and I want to do this not for that purpose of course but I want to do this because I don't think people understand really what it feels like to have you know depression and have had it for you know you're a whole entire life I mean I think everyone goes through bouts of it every you know now and then and they bounce right out of it but being in a constant state of it is is very mentally draining and I don't like it I don't like the fact that my meds aren't working but I'm going through the side-effects of every one of them I don't want to do it anymore I don't I don't like the state of where I'm at and I know that I am the sole person responsible for where it is I'm located and in this life but I don't really have the mental capacity to change it so it kind of throws basically my whole entire life into turmoil probably will be for the next couple days I would think but I just want to just say hey I guess kind of int a little bit try to see if someone else understands what it is I'm going through and kind of understand that if someone was to say would you take my kids cancer and me die I would be on it into without any questions if suicidal it's not even the word to be using right now because it's kind of beyond that step you know it's kind of like you feel it and you're waiting for the next trigger and it's going to just destroy me it's going to destroy me so this video channel that I just started maybe the end of you know just a few short videos of what my last you know feelings thoughts are and unfortunately they're not all that great but here take your watch this or in the same seat that I'm sure that you'll probably kind of understand and more than likely I'll probably go to bed and I'll wake up a different human being so well sorry for throwing this out here like that I just thought that I'd share and you guys all have a very good night our good day and I will talk to you guys later okay hi	Character count: 3041 | Duration in seconds: 309 | Characters per second: 9.8

like a lot different pies I feel like if I'm gonna do this whole YouTube thing I'm gonna have to be honest with you guys that's if somebody ever watches this I don't know but the thing is that um I've been going through a really tough time these past ones I started this YouTube channel just to get my mind of things I guess and it completely worked like I have something to do now and I'm gonna go more into why later in this video for me it's like a video diary I use it to get my mind off things and it worked I know the first videos are like a very shitty but I've been learning to it and it's fun for me just here in my bed I'm sick I like I have my laptop right here cuz I have a lot to talk about I guess we can start with depression so when I was young I was a very strange kid because I had this unusual concerns about everything like when I think about it now if my kid is gonna have the questions I had when I was four five six seven eight nine I don't know what I would do what I say like I was always worried I was just so weird and like I have the weirdest example the only one up that pops to my head right now is that when I was like 11 my friend from school from my class we were walking home from school one day and he started smoking and I was this little innocent girl 10 11 years old and I was like and my anxiety kicked in and I didn't know it was anxiety then so I was just paranoid for the rest of the day because I thought that I would know like maybe that's just so weird like of course it's up to me I always wrote these little letters with my concerns because I was too shy to go and talk about them no way to get things off my chest at that time was to write things down and put the paper under the door under the bathroom door on my parents room at night and they read it called me I went there they were like it's okay baby don't think about that it's nothing give me a kiss and a hug and I went to sleep and that was my way of dealing with anxiety at the time or just go talk to my mom and dad and like get things off my chest and then I was just good but as the years have passed I've kind of grown away from my dad and my mom I found it harder to talk to her and I hope she's never gonna see this because it's gonna break her heart to hear that but that was the case so I just started to hold things in and hide everything that was wrong and then they would just build up to these anxiety attacks and later on depression since I was like 12 I knew something was wrong with me depression is it Audrey used to work because it's like a word you use on your board and you go like that so depressed enemy with that but there are some people that are really struggling with depression and anxiety like it is a mental illness and it is very serious I started getting panic attacks like full-on and I never knew what it was like it feels just literally like you're dying it's not a good feeling and I fainted sometimes it was just horrible the summer of 2013 that's when he got very serious and I got them a lot that summer and I go with it it was like extreme extreme anxiety like when you get these panic attacks and they just build up to when you're done having one they just built up for me like in here like I'm nervous about getting the next one and I get him again and it's horrible I didn't really know I was depressed until like a year ago because like I said I always knew there was something wrong with me I can't hold a job and I can't go like a week getting up every day just cool I used to call him like once twice a week sick it's just not right that this is not okay and that's not normal but I just always thought I was lazy I guess and like I can to finish these things I started and I feel horrible like the most heartbreaking one was sports because I really enjoyed it I have much potential I just can't follow through or go through with anything so like a year ago I I just was certain that I depression I'm a very open person and like I have this thing that I always want to make people feel comfortable around me and I'm very upbeat and happy around people so when I do feel though I just don't go out at all because I don't want people to see me that way so when things got serious people didn't really believe it I guess I got medication for it this summer it helped me a lot in the beginning I have been getting these lows you know they have gotten deeper and deeper it annoys me so much that I can't be stable like I'm always up here or down here like it got to the point where this summer I couldn't get out of bed and then my mom was like let's talk to a doctor and this is not okay it's just heartbreaking to lay in bed and like for me it was my mom she was always checking on me and just being really nice to me and very patient and trying to get me to do things like trying to get up and take a walk with her through something and when she told me she loved me and kissed me and I couldn't even smile back like I was so numb and it's so heartbreaking because it's a person you love and you wanna be thankful and give it back but I just couldn't so we went to talk to a doctor or I couldn't when the doctor for me I got medication for it and yes like I said it helped me a lot in the beginning I felt unstoppable I was like oh my gosh this is amazing being able to wake up in the mornings and I thought that was just enough for me but then I got the next load and it was just Saudi and these past months I haven't gotten a high like I haven't gotten up and down I've just been going down and I started drinking a lot I have alcoholism in my family it runs up in the family and I started drinking every single night and partying a lot and I was just drinking because I like the feeling of going to sleep it was easier to go to sleep my mind wasn't like [Music] thinking like it was just easier to fall asleep and drink yourself to the state or you're numb and you don't feel anything you're not having these thoughts so I kind of like that and it always got more and more so I was like drinking two bottles a night just completely alone when I went to bed drinking like two bottles or like a vodka to be honest it got to the point where if I had a night out I couldn't stop the day after and what I did not know then was that alcohol takes away the effects of the medicine I was drinking to forget when the alcohol went out of my body I felt over and lower it's not a good feeling I was just drinking myself down I think that leads up to when I tried to kill myself I had a night out nothing happened it was a good night but I blacked out and when i black out the next day is so hard my anxiety goes if I can't remember one second of the night I wake up with anxiety like crazy so I had that night out I probably ought to sleep at like 7:00 in the morning and my friend came over stayed the night wrong with that but I don't even remember him being here I woke up so drunk at 3 o'clock in the afternoon the next day and I just felt so pathetic I was like what am I doing with my life and I just felt miserable I was like why am I like this why do I do this to myself like I am such a fuckup I can't do anything right like I said I it makes me feel worse that I am I have so much potential I do good at school and I do good at sports I had an amazing job and made some record to sales record and I had just thrown that all away and I was just unlocked bottom so I had this moment that I just didn't want to live anymore I just didn't want to keep going and I've been having like suicidal thoughts two months before nobody was home and I I just went into some soul like I don't know how to describe it I was just I couldn't think of anything positive I was so low I just wanted to kill myself I just wanted to end this and I tried there was no wine at home except this one bottle it's like I don't know 80 percent or something I don't even know what it's called and I took sleep title them down with that bottle and I said on the kitchen floor because I got a knife from there and started cutting myself and I thought that was gonna be easy because I didn't really feel physical pain at that stain but it just um was harder than I thought so I was like why isn't this working like with a huge at night and it's always started like sawing and I was just sawing until I fell asleep from the pills I thought that was my rock bottom but when I woke up to my mom freaking out crying she found me on the floor and she was just like hysterical and I [Music] had not thought about if it failed but that happened and that was heartbreaking to see my mom there [Music] and they made me throw up then I was just watched 24/7 my best friend came over and took me to the hospital and I was just my eyes were so swollen from crying and I was just a mess and I got a few interviews and then the mental doctor came he took me to a mental Center I stayed there for three days talking to therapists and doctors and nurses and I was watched 24/7 that really got to the root of the problem and that helped me a lot I got some answers I took like a lot of tests for mental health and it was just a lot of depression and anxiety and of course alcoholism so the first thing I had to do was go to rehab to them see how bad my anxiety and depression is because alcohol numbs you I had to get alcohol out of the whole picture to them see I was theme and how serious my depression and anxiety and so that's what's happening now my mom and dad were going to America to visit my sister and they decided to take me with them because they didn't want to leave me alone now I'm back we were in America for a week tomorrow is a day I have to call and let them know that I'm back and go to rehab and I am kind of nervous I don't know how it all works and I never thought I would be in this position because I don't know there's nothing wrong with my life I have a very supportive and a good family and good friends and we're not poor there's nothing wrong with you so that's what people think all the time that something has to happen for people like me I guess like something has to be wrong or something has to happen or you go through some trauma or something to end up like me but it's just mental disease really there's nothing you can do about it like I'm certain I was born like this like in my first relationship I was just crying at night for no reason like sometimes when I went to bed I just started bawling and I had no reason I just felt so low and my boyfriend at the time was trying to comfort me and he was like of course he was like what's wrong what's wrong I just started making up something because I didn't know myself and that's been happening for years now and nothing happened to me I wasn't raped or doing anything nothing happened really it's just a mental disease so if some of you are relating in any way I just want you to know that you're not alone I guess there's a lot of people I bet the same thought and yeah but the nurses at the hospital and mental center were like really proud of me for coming in so soon before it gets bad if that makes sense because at the state I was something was going to happen like when I was out partying or like I was sure I would have done something so stupid and something I would regret for the rest of my life and they were just like making me realized that I am only 21 and I have my whole life ahead of me although I feel or felt like a fuckup and like I had messed up my life and couldn't or wouldn't do anything with it they reassured that it's just beginning really I'm young and that's where I am right now I just got home from America this morning um we arrived at 6:00 7:00 this morning I slept from like 10:00 to 4:00 today it is 3:30 at night because I just couldn't sleep and this is like therapy for me I swear so people have been making fun of me for this whole YouTube thing and speaking English because I shared it on social media and of course the majority is Icelandic people one video got up to thousand views and that's of course the junk Challenge which I have hidden now for obvious reasons just a while going through these a couple of weeks I was never gonna like I was gonna make this secret hardly and just do a whole new identity and tried to reach viewers from like from abroad and I found of course people are making fun of me here I mean like I don't speak good English at all but I just try because that's what I want to do and at that little point I was like everything I just want to do what makes me happy and what takes my mind of things that's why I'm sitting here tonight and yeah you get to a certain point it's just when you get older you realize that you can't let other people's opinion affect your life I let other people's opinion affect me a lot I was always thinking about what other people thought of me and I wanted to hold my image and I delay I let other people opinions like control of me I don't know if I'm even gonna post this but I can't really imagine what's going to happen if I do I bet people that call themselves my friend are probably not gonna contact me through all of it I have to keep people in my life that make me feel good about myself and help me and understand and tolerate me that's closest I haven't been reading from it but I am a completely different person like I would like another person from the person I was 2 years ago like Becca she has helped me so much and I don't know what I did to deserve a person like her to be my friend but when we got to know each other some people are like whatever you do don't make friends with her she's crazy she and we've talked about this like I told her that and and I know it's just from jealousy because she is very proud like like everyone should be and she's just such a strong person when I got to know her I saw myself in her I feel like really same person but she has already been through what I've been through and she's older than me and has experienced more and I just saw myself in her and she is just so I don't even know how to describe her she's so beautiful talented ambitious mature and so fun and she was crazy in a good way I met her this summer she was my box and that that's when I was just lost like I was just drawn to trouble like she had been through some things I looked up to her but she is like she's in my face if I do anything stupid if I do anything wrong and she just is so good for me and she helped me through all of this she helped me accept that I have a problem and I need to work on it because I I just hold stuff in and when we have been friends for a few months I went through some stuff that I'm not going to talk about but that was a time when I had to be strong for other people and she broke down a few times but I didn't because I just hold stuff in and I just that's how I've been all my life and she really helped me open up and accept things that are happening and made me realize that I have to deal with them or else something like this is going to happen and I just yeah I just don't know what I did to deserve that person that was her that drove me to the hospital she was like she went up to my bed when I was in the bathroom and she was like my mom's working a shift I am gonna take her to the hospital to the ER like then I came and I was like why you talking to my dad I heard him say like is there anything I don't know like what doesn't he just ask me like I was just like it was crazy so she was like stop this to me for a second my mom was working a shift you're on that okay right now are you okay with me taking it to the hospital and I was like sure I got dressed it was like at midnight one day that was the point where I just broke down for the first time ever I just started bawling as I was putting my clothes on because I just found a relief I just thought that I would be okay because at the time I thought I was not gonna be healed that it was impossible for me to ever feel normal and she was so good to me she was like it's okay baby it's okay just cry it's okay that's kind of the whole story I don't know if I'm ever gonna post this or what's gonna happen if I do that's what's happening in my life right now those three days in the mental center I figured so much I I'm so much better I'm not suicidal anymore now I feel like of course I'm very nervous about going in and maybe not being home for Christmas even but I just feel like everything that I've wanted to do in the past like all the things I want to accomplish I feel like when I'm done with rehab I'm so like I know that I'm gonna accomplish these things I'm just so hopeful again to close the whole story this whole process this month has really made my family bond again that's the best feeling ever like when I was in the metal center my dad came twice they that really surprised me he just really talked to me for the first time in years he just really opened up to this whole thing and we he said in one of the talks with a doctor and I had to answer all these questions in front of him when that was done I felt so good he just sat there and listened and I felt so good and I just realized that it was just like when I was younger so this whole process has made us like I think I'll wrap it up now I will keep you updated on the rehab thing please stay tuned for the travel block from Atlanta back to Iceland we spent a day in Boston and it was awesome and I will see you I will see you soon if you're still watching this thank you so much for listening to me I just want all the people even if there's just one person watching this going through the same thing or it can relate to some of it in any way I just want you to know that you are not alone and things are going to be okay hold on be patient get help work on things you're not alone the day that micah came and took me to the hospital she came with this and she told me that this has helped her out before and she put it right there next to my bed and he told me to look at it every day i can't wake up or go to bed without seeing this and it just makes me feel good it feels like she's awakened me it says tomorrow is a lovely day um I guess that's I couldn't wait to end this video [Music] you	Character count: 18296 | Duration in seconds: 1473 | Characters per second: 12.4

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_idBTEiHbL4		I hate my life, I'm done with it	hey what's up guys and girls my name is Danielle and welcome to my youtube channel and this title is kind of based on my view really of this realization yesterday from Hawaii and baby wood was a experience trip so the last couple of days I've been really depressed and just felt horrible and not powerless about doing you know doing my goals and you know there's breast since years so I decided to go on this trip because you know I know what this is do so I felt like getting myself out of this state and you know what took like 12 seats I cut off the outside part of it I crushed it up put the powder in lemon juice extracted it in an hour or something i filtered it then I drank it and you know I expected this trip to to make me super conscious and get me some confidence and you know stuff needs to be stronger and bigger than the feelings coming off my from like a subconscious because this is what I experienced that I do and when I landed trip kicked in I kind of experience instead of this I experienced just absolutely hate anger and you know frustration and this realization that my life is shit just disculpa little doll enjoy and and and I felt like I just want to live leave things behind everything the way I do things because it just gave me frustration I just do things badly and I really need to change because I'd only enjoy my life even if I kind of bushes myself that you know I do and I'm you know improving myself and going in the good direction I don't so just some things are things that I hate in my life well okay the good thing is I'm healthy I can only one hundred years and I had the potential to change I had friends calling I have family I do have love so my life is not bad at all but the way I live it and this emotional or habitual hamster wheel is just really frustrating and and then just stuck in this habit in my head and can't get out of it and the more I frustratedly try to improve myself and do things right the washes gets so one very bad thing is that you know I'm depressed since years because of personal conflict with a girl for another country that I met and I felt if she can wrong with me and I still miss her but I gave her a lot of hate for wrong in me and actually never wants to see me again which makes me feel sad but at the same time I hate her because I can't forgive and this kind of made me depressed and this part is very logical and you know you're expected to get over things and while just talking my head for in a very long time because I do I'm more interested in doing my own stuff instead of obeying having a job like a lot of times at home which obviously an easy way of being depressed now I want to do this YouTube stuff and you know like being depressed it will get you that gets you in this hamster wheel of bad habit self-medicating with something having a bad sleep damn depressed again trying to make wheel then it's just not that good on make one video than anyone I didn't have a success on YouTube which makes me frustrated and makes me depressed again and I just you know hate the whole thing waking up procrastinating a lot of times I stopped cleaning and watching YouTube videos or wasting time on the Internet meaningless stuff waste time on my phone then I you know I can't bullshit myself that I try to improve my life then I end up doing nothing and I don't even take time to rest you know meet friends so it's just the whole thing is absolute garbage and it doesn't work at all you know even like I try to do this no fat thing you know chase girls and it's also just very frustrating and the more you chase girls the more it's like gets away [Music] and so I felt this realization that this whole thing is absolutely fundamentally wrong I felt like I was sick I mean depression is a sickness you know but I was sick but I got used to it and I forgot that I sick so I just thought this is the natural way of living being obsessed with you know self-improvement trying to improve yourself having all the frustration with it and the more you frustrated the more things not go well and when I said I hate it and then that's this is not good fuck this shit fuck monetization I just felt a sense of relief I felt happiness that can just not care about anything it's always felt like a pile article suicide like when you die then you reborn just not nothing bothers you anymore the weight of the world just got off my shoulders and I was able to have a second glimpse of things and you know recollect stuff and and you know how to live my life you know I mean problems are there you have to pay the bills but even they need to take things too seriously in emotional level you know having solution it is what matters so it like I said it kind of feels like watching a very very bad movie in cinema and you're like I don't want me to watch this till the end I just skip it and start a new one go to another room in the cinema and start a cool movie or when you want you can't build a building when there is already building there or do you have to just fundamentally destroy it and you know exciting extolled it and build a new one so what I did what I decided to do is I just tweaked up my whole routines today just do things absolutely differently so the old trigger points the old frustration just won't be there because I just go and accomplish the different path so what I did is I sleep on this two-person bed and I decided to sleep on another part of it because you know the day starts with waking up so at this I woke up the other part of it so it was a little bit different it was like rebooting my life and instead of like you know meditating or or going to the gym like being tired I kind of accepted that I'm still tired and stuff I had a cold shower or boss myself up and I just had just come here and you know make videos and then feel happy about accomplishing I decided to because of this I've not switch on my computer and waste time there like it's a lot of time wasting when I just wish switched on my computer and and ended up twisting one or two hours just watching meaningless YouTube videos when I had my morning poop I didn't swipe you know girls on tinder because I'm not I don't care about girls anymore actually does anyone does this like you know swiping pooping swipe you know being in the toilet and tinder just let me know in the comment section you know I just wasn't in my phone wasn't doing meaningless stuff on the internet just came here and doing stuff that's you know go somewhere and and doing something that actually gets me a lot better life because for example this person who wrong with me I constantly just can't bear our lives she has like pretty amazing life traveling to exotic places I'm like also had this frustration about being such upset by it but I'm depressed and not going anywhere and she's like having fun so like I said we're talking of my daily routine I just decided to do keep the force that you know gets me somewhere and makes me happy gives me an accomplishment and just have a let go of the sparks that I just absolutely don't need and you know having a baby would Rose it just really really helped me to have a moment of not caring not giving shit and like letting go the attachments and worries and cravings of how things should be and just having a sense of happiness having an ability to like choose to do something different because like I said you know when you have problems in some areas of life of your life you know having procrastination or depression you know like pretty frustrated and so focused on unchanging it kind of just you get obsessed with the frustration and I try to do things differently and it just always just ended up doing things the same way and it kind of allows me to do things differently and and I just realized we all die some day and because of this life is kind of meaningless because you built something in your life I go to the gym build muscles villainized body then in home it will like perish and in 70 years or 100 years and if life doesn't have you can have any meaning then the only meaning of it is enjoy it enjoy the moment enjoy purely even the moments when you like working for your income and stuff like that and like it got like I said it made me happy and got this weight of the world of my shoulders and you know when you're happy things are a lot easier you know you are yeah without the stress you're easier to decide to do things in the right way or see things clearly what works what doesn't so well pretty happy now the way my day started having accomplishments and I'm happy about being happy so yeah sometimes you have a need to have a let go and and burn the boats and recall that your life do things absolutely differently let go of the frustrations and accept things a little bit so I guess that's all I wanted to say if you enjoyed this video please give it a like and like I said let me know in the comments section if you do this Boop and swiping and also what do you think about what I said do you had this experience or do you feel like you should just rethink your life and a little bit reboot it from from the point of waking up and do things differently [Music] let me know in the comments section please be in touch my other videos to you and eventually end up my subscribing to my channel and I wish you an amazing day	Character count: 9335 | Duration in seconds: 811 | Characters per second: 11.5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QaFDXhclc4		I Just Can't Take it Anymore!	I'm going to try and do this video without the cat knocking over the camera speaking over me or anything like that his name is chewy and right now he's demanding my attention and something else I don't know what that something else is but he wants it so if you see a black tail doing things like this or a black face coming and doing things like this that's him it's just chewy he's just saying hi and he's saying give it to me and I don't know what it is anyway okay that's let's not get carried away so the last week or so maybe a little less than a week an experience has been coming up within me that doesn't happen very often but when it does happen it hits quite hard and that is the experience of feeling overwhelmed so I have a lot of things that I do every day a lot of different responsibilities there's a lot of practical things that I take care of my day-to-day life with animals with my responsibilities with a destiny with get real page etc etc so over the weekend My partner and I got a puppy that I in an ideal world wouldn't have gotten but because of our living situation this particular breed of dog is very protective plus with training it's a very good asset at the end of the day to have to basically protect me in a situation with where there's an attack or something like that so that's why we got the puppy and you know for me we really have a lot of animals that I take care of I already have a very full day every day and night every night that's it's a lot so this puppy kind of was the store on the camel's back and the last week I've just been like in a haze of befuddlement which stems from this kind of overwhelmingness and for me what happens when I feel overwhelmed as I get Moody I get kind of like depressive I get closed off shut off it's kind of like I retreat into my safe little shell and what effect this has is that I find that I'm not focused it's like almost as of within having these all of these things to do I'm not actually focusing myself to do one at a time in an effective way it's like like I said it's like this haze so I figured that this would be the perfect topic to talk about since it's something that's here right now and it's something that I'm not alone and experiencing there are a lot of people in the world to go through this kind of experience and it's not about how much we're doing it's not about each person's different unique situation and and only people who have this amount of things that they have to take care of in the day should feel overwhelmed and if you don't have that much stuff then you shouldn't be feeling overwhelmed because you don't actually have all that much look at how much I have deal with sorry it's irrelevant how much we are each individually dealing with in our lives we are each in different positions we have different life experiences we have different skills and capabilities in terms of how and what we deal with in our day to day lives so that is what I first of all asked you if you have that particular reaction within you of other people who don't do as much as I'm doing shouldn't feel overwhelmed because then they're just being little pussies please drop it this is not about you and about your judgement of what other people should and should not experience in what situations and what contexts take a moment to remember that everyone is in a different position everyone has led a different life and everyone has different thresholds and tolerance levels so yes some people do struggle with significantly less of a workload compared to someone who can deal with five times that workload before they get to that experience of feeling overwhelmed so having said all of those things let's get down to the crux so the experience I feel feeling overwhelmed comes from this kind of powerlessness of how am I supposed to do everything that I need to do how am I supposed to get through everything how am I supposed to do anything all of this stuff no one's helping me I'm all alone in this can't it doesn't fit into every day I literally am not able to complete everything that I need to complete without compromising some of the stuff so it's all of these kind of accumulated little things like that the sense of powerlessness the sense of feeling rushed of feeling pressure and all of these things accumulate and contribute towards at the end of the day then feeling overwhelmed feeling like okay I just can't deal with this I don't I'm not I can't I don't can't do it and it's not enough of me to do all this so yes each of those particular thoughts they do have a grounding in reality or not all of them but a lot of them like for example I can't possibly it's not humanly possible for me to complete all of these tasks within the time that I have available so okay yes that is a realistic federación however what we tend to do is we attach these emotional experiences to that so instead of looking at it practically and saying okay this is not going to work how can I find a solution how can I delegate how can I cut certain things out how can I prioritize what we tend to do is we go oh my god how am I going to do all of this stuff and we go into this emotional meltdown or we just feel angry or we just feel anxious or whatever it is we start attaching these emotions to this point and that is what contributes towards that end of the day there's big implosion of I cannot deal with this I cannot do this I I'm just gonna give up or I'm just gonna crawl into my cave or I'm just gonna sit in this foggy haze forever and told something happens so that is very very possibly the defining factor of the issue that actually contributes and primarily to that experience of feeling overwhelmed that emotional aspect that we keep attaching to these things the emotional approach that we have to the issues the the problems the challenges and the tasks that we are faced with so solution is quite simple drop those emotional experiences meaning that okay why are they being triggered why am I feeling powerless why am i feeling helpless why am i feeling anxious why am i responding in this way when I can see that it's not effective it's not supportive rather than just keeping it practical just dealing with things as they come and looking at my responsibilities in a more objective way so go through that process of investigation of all of these emotional attachments that have crept in to this thing that has now become feeling so overwhelming feeling so overwhelmed but in conjunction with that what is important and what is really more part of the living solution is whenever we get to that point of feeling overwhelmed or feeling I can't deal with us all those little thoughts start creeping in why is no one helping me or I couldn't possibly do all of this I'm all alone I can't and then feeling depressed or feeling angry or feeling anxious or little thoughts like I shouldn't even be doing all these things anyway you know it's not even my problem why am I making this my problem things like that that start creeping in those are the points where we need to immediately apply correction where we need to practice that self-awareness of okay I'm having this thought and I know where the sport leads I know this particular thought is going to take me eventually to that experience of feeling overwhelmed so I'm gonna stop this thought now I'm going to change how I'm looking at this situation how I'm approaching this situation I'm going to change how I'm dealing with it within myself so that this experience or feeling overwhelmed doesn't build and build and build and get to that point of explosion or implosion so for example my point of practicing correction is in these moments where I feel overwhelmed [Music] I'm going to rather make it to-do list prioritize the to-do list and start working through each point step by step and not let myself stay in that hazy experience where I become less effective because what that does is actually then accumulates onto the experience of feeling overwhelmed because I'm not getting the things done that I need to get done at least not in the way that I know I'm capable of so I I need to be strict with myself about going into that haze and I need to be strict with myself about practicing a more effective way to deal with my responsibilities yes maybe some of them I might need to put aside for now in terms of maybe they I just literally cannot get to everything I need to consider that so those are all of the practical considerations that I need to me Joey what are you doing he's back okay I'm gonna in the video now before this gets ugly all right if you have any questions comments or I he just turned my computer on or you'd like to me to expand on anything or anything like

I stayed to myself do you know I have friends don't get me wrong but I'm just saying this it ain't me you know what I mean the ones because of the language even you've got friends in your life and you love them and treat them right in you here for them to take and then age they still fuck you over like you try to use judgment and you try to see people for who they are I'm never able to do that when I think that I motherfuckers real and I think that they're honest and that lawyer net trustworthy they turn out to be deceitful liars and manipulators and just bad people know what I'm saying so I just getting to a point now I just don't wanna do it nobody how am I having a chat buddy or something like that before his friends I can do without you can't help me get to the next level I hope you

I'm gonna I don't feel like I don't want to make it to 40 anyway not with my life not the way I stressed and unhappy as I being sometimes dealing with people shit man I cannot see any way possible did I get the 40 I don't know if I'd be here number 10 years I really don't think Jayla 47 would be on this earth in ten years ten years from now I just my personal opinion I don't I don't feel like it I don't see it I don't imagine it and to be honest I don't want I really don't care if I died a day it would honestly it'd be the best thing that could've ever because I'm just I'm just fed up with people I don't like people you know they they just liars they're just the seat the seat fool they they not I think this honest you know I just and for me it just thing like I just had like a bad luck charm you know what I mean it's like I try to do good in this world and all I ever get back in return is bad back back back you know it was like can you get a job Jay that's gonna work for you a job where you want to make the money that you want to make a job where you want to be comfortable at that you were like where you have good coworkers no can't get that all you're gonna be able to be able to go back and finish college my situation and my living arrangements and things like that stops me from doing that and you know what I mean me money to go to college you know I mean every time I try to get some type of help as always the type of burden on the court so that's not the book right now and I need money I don't got time for college you know I mean it'd be hard for me to do that anyway you know and then it's like what about your depression you know what I mean I'm still going through that I don't know they might know but I'm mentally though I have major depression I mean so you're not trying to take medicine for that but that just seemed like that just gets worse my depression is not improving at all like ever since my father died and my grandmom died just like it's just been getting worse and worse and worse you feel me so that's not improving you know relationships you try to you know get in relationships for people but people buddy don't want that you know they don't know how to be honest you know I mean you give you all and they only they only give you 25% but you give a hundred percent you know it's just all around the board man I'm just this unhappy but a lot of things that go on man I'm just fully I don't like this world I don't like this world I don't like people you know I mean it seemed like life is just so fucked up and unfair it's like good people like me we gotta suffer you know we don't have happiness we don't have mom and I'm not saying I'm not happy like I'm the worst person in the world like as bad as I can be but I'm just not I'm mad because I'm not where I thought I would be at 27 I thought I would be much further know what I am I'm not you know and you look around you see all these evil motherfuckers and people who are not good people they just moving up in life and you just add a stance though you know what I mean and they just first raise me man you know I had thought about suicide like two weeks ago I think like my friendship he was keeping a room when I was I had a real bad day and I was just like what's the point man like what's the point of living his life like I I was like fuck this shit man I might just kill myself you know I mean I was really thinking about some that's the first time in a while I actually thought like that I just really was just like like was my purpose here you know saying like I can't work at the type of job that I would like to work at and you know I can't find the type of relationship that I want you know for the person that I want to be in a relationship with you know I'm not where I want to be financially you know I'm not in the city I want to be in you know everything nothing's going my way just nothing you know saying so and then my family issues I'm not really on great terms with my family so my thing is just like what's the fucking point you know I mean my nigga like like what's the point in and living you know I mean like you just bet all day if I'm saying like that's the way I feel sometimes that's way I feel if you ain't gonna be happy than wanted and I mean like who didn't wait for happiness but I got time for that nobody trying to wait for happiness nobody got time to you know I mean it's been a long time you know I mean since I've been really really happy you know since fucking 2000-2001 am I gonna tell them to wait no no 13 more years you know I mean but I might be happy I'll be 40 years old doesn't want to wait waiting to be 40 to need to be happy you found sad now I don't even see myself getting 40 you know not the way I be stressed out man is like you just can't trust people man people just manipulators and liars and deceitful and just you know I saw some diet or be loved on YouTube even soccer - issues so I said fuck it I might as well get up on here and do yellow Vito I need be one of these in years always talk about issues but I never talked about like update you guys what's going on in my life you know cuz ain't nothing much going on in it for me to update you guys on that's why I'm doing videos like they do name my negativity you know people I want to hear negative shit you know but yeah that's pretty much what I have to say it's nothing one of my subscribers I want to do a video I was like her outdoor deal or you know I don't see mister point but I'll do one but then I don't like myself I don't like myself you know I mean like I just wish I was more loose I wish I was more like I don't know charlie I feel like I'm always like serious you know I mean like you don't seem I think will gravitate towards me you know it's like people can't relate to me you know like if I'm just with a bunch of people at a social gathering I'm just to myself I'm very like standoffish you know I just don't like people you know I just don't I don't trust people you know I think that's why I don't trust them I just thought like people are always there to just fuck you over cuz it's all about all I've ever dealt with I've given my heart to people and they just take advantage of it you know I mean so I'm just I've just gotten to a point where it's just like no thank you even if I think a person is good I'm night mm-hmm the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk-ZU5UOzcM	suicidal	How I Feel Right Now (Warning: VERY Emotional)	this is probably the ugliest you're ever going to see me like because I haven't looked this bad a long time and the reason why looks like bad is because I probably been crying non-stop for the past three days I'm sorry I need blue this is running so probably wondering why I look like a troll I don't even know what's going on I don't want to put on clothes understand this I don't care what I look like because I just need to get this off my chest this is the worst time of my entire life there's no feeling worse than what I'm feeling and I don't know what's gonna happen because as I'm recording this I don't know what's going on in my relationship we're supposed to have broken up but no I I'm not I don't know I feel like I can still do thing I can't solve egde this and I'm trying so hard because it's my entire life and I hate everything except this I don't want to talk to anyone right now so that's why I'm talking to this camera because it can't talk back because I don't want people to talk back to me because I hate people giving me advice because it makes me feel worse when people say shit to be like oh maybe it's for the best Blabberize like shut up I don't want doing that what I want to hear it's that everything is going to be okay and I'm going to be fine because I don't feel fine I don't think it's gonna be okay and I don't know what more I could do because if this is over then so it's my life there's nothing what I want to do right now and just die I know that's horrible but if you knew how I felt right now when you're alone and you're crying and there's no one here to comfort you we could see just laughs he did comfort me but I don't know how it feels anymore and I've said everything but I just I just can't I just couldn't do it because life is this bad now I can't stop thinking about everything this no I I'm sorry this is such a mess I'm trying to get both words out but it's hard because okay I'm sorry about that I just pulled out my nose piercing like a fucking idiot because I was wiping my nose and I accidentally ripped it out for the second time that's happened that's happened to me before um I was sorry yeah um I just wanted this to be over or I can wish I could just and do right now so I don't have to feel like this anymore so I don't have to go through any pain he's already been in constant pain for three days and my anxiety is just the highest that can they ever be so much so that it it fuck's up my digestive system well it already have a digestive problem and anxiety makes it like really worse it because the stress on your in like and gastrointestinal tract or whatever it is like it just just fucks it up had always seemed stress and anxiety whatever like it's all that and I'm surprised I haven't had a panic attack I've almost nearly had a few panic attacks but my body's doesn't sus ago saying I guess but you know I get like a choking feeling and my hair's like really bothering me I get like a choking feeling and just my stomach just just in constant pain and my mind can't stop cycling negative thoughts and this is my absolute worst that you ever see me at so feel privileged that are you enjoying either side me cuz I don't want to put like my personal life out here I just don't know what else to do right now can you shut up I don't know what else to do because I don't want to talk to anyone because nothing anyone says right now it's going to change anything it's not going to help me it's not gonna make me feel better and it's anything it will just be I'm sorry it doesn't make me feel worse I need more tissue yeah it'll just make me feel worse to talk to anyone right now the only one person I want to talk to his him and I can't talk to him until he's back so I'm just sitting here right now talking to the camera because it's a way to get my emotions out rather than just talking to a wall I guess and you're all seeing this um I I don't say I'm trying to keep my calm but you know it's like I have permanently like puffy eyes and bags under my eyes because I can uh-huh like it takes me like it takes me hours to get to sleep because of the anxiety just takes its toll so much and gives me a headache and my eyes always perfectly so that's why I haven't seen videos from me and I don't want to stop posting videos I want to let you know what's going on in my life because that's what it's all about talking it's vlogging in my life and showing you what's going on and I want it for myself even though I don't I don't know if I'll be able to watch this all back through because so painful is knowing if I look back on this video when I feel better I'm like it will break my heart to see me like this I'm sure that it breaks your hearts too but please don't please don't be sad for me you don't feel sorry for me because this nothing you guys could do to save me but the thing is I don't want to die as I do want to experience the rest of my life but if I have to feel like this that's the only way out there is nothing else there's nothing don't come at me with therapy bullshit because no I don't want to talk to anyone about anything nothing any therapist could say it's going to help and that's how I've always felt whenever I've been sad and or depressed or whatever it's like no I don't want to talk to anyone it would just make me burst out crying to talk about my problems like this and what are they going to say that's going to help once they can't fix it they can't fix how you feel because you don't want to do anything like lots of people listen to understand it's like people don't seek out help because they don't want it because they think it can't help them because they're in such a dark place they don't even will leave that house or whatever and they don't want to go through the process that it takes you can get into therapy it's not just that easy you have to go see your doctor and get referred to a therapist and then you might not be able to get a session for a really long time and when you do you probably not gonna see them often so no I don't I don't know how I will see like you can prevent people from committing suicide because it's bullshit advice to tell somebody to get help if they just don't want help and they don't want to talk to anyone there's enough I don't think there's anything that can be done like I don't think some of these suicides I don't think they can be prevented because I know exactly how it feels cause right now I am suicidal I know how it feels and in my mind frame right frame of mind right now because I'm a rational okay you need to understand that that when people didn't commit suicide they're irrational they don't think of the consequences they just do it it's done what's that in that frame of mind not seeing nothing in the world that you say or do it is going to stop them like unless you can physically stop them from doing it to themselves then it's going to happen you know I mean like the only thing that stops me from doing it it's just the impact on everyone else I couldn't do it to my family because my family would fall apart and I'm too scared to die anyway because I I don't know how it feels and it's too scary to me I think I could ever go through with it but it's like I still feel like I want to die like in a painless way and in a way that it won't affect him when I was which is pretty much it possible but this is my frame of mind I'm a rational and that's what summit you have to understand about people is that when they're in a certain frame of mind it's irrational so they do something stupid like people that self-harm they do it because they just can't find another way to release but something that would never meet like I'd never do it again because I mean the last time I did it all goes back up the relationship so I know if I did it again he would definitely not want to be with me anymore but I've been perfect I'm not perfect but now perfect I've done everything right and I just don't feel like I deserve this and this this doesn't need to happen like this is unnecessary it really is and I really hope there's something I can do and just nothing anyone says is helpful so I don't want to reach out to anyone close to me right now I only have like one good friend and then I have my family but my family are just gonna tell me that that I deserve better all this bullshit don't care I am never going to feel this way about someone else like I only want him he's the only person in the world that could possibly cover me and make me feel that right now I think as anyone says or does it help it's irrelevant and even coming out of anyone elses mouth is irrelevant I'm I'm sorry that I feel this way but I do I've wracked in my life by doing this because I put all my eggs in one basket my happiness is dependent on him and no one else and I actually don't like visiting my family anymore because every time I go that I feel so sad and anxious because I'm away from him and I should never let myself get this attached but I can help it it just it just happened so now there's nothing I can do except just do anything I can to stay like this I can stay stable mentally stable I don't think I'll ever be strong enough to to be on my own because I hate myself I don't want to be alone my some of my stupid negative thoughts I hate your life myself I need someone there they can physically put their arm around me and tell me everything's fine and nobody can do that if I don't have him because nobody else knows me in that way do you understand that no family member can do that because it's just weird I don't want to cry in front of my family and I don't want to cause them trouble god I'm so sorry but you had to see me like this but I'm just so broken and the only way I'm gonna be put back together as if he he was stay with me otherwise my whole life is over this is my life and I can't go back to what it was before because I hate that I hate and my dad's house where I stay when I go that I hate it there I hate everything about it it's so depressing it makes me feel so sad so Oh like I'll never be on its sleep again like every hour a day would just be torture and it pretty much is right now anyway he said well when I wake up I feel okay for a cup of hours and then it just always starts hitting me like what's going like do something and I'm sorry I don't know what more I can save it that's what's going on right now and I just wanted he would know what's going on because I'm trying to capture my life and and all that's happening within it and I wanted to leave this out I don't want to get personal but this is like this is kind of like therapy for me is talking to the camera because it makes me feel like let I'm not being judged even though the people that see this I'm probably gonna judge me anyway but I didn't give a fuck right I don't care about anything or anyone except him like he's all the mess right now and anything that anyone says to me that's horrible I just don't care because people are irrelevant so people would hate on me I'm rather than fine go ahead but you can't hurt me anymore because there's nothing can hurt me more than this right now there's there's nothing that can contribute like I'll just be like oh okay but I already feel shit anyway so what's the point who want to kick me when I'm down I doubt any of you would anyway but just anyone that dislikes me for have a reason I fucked up many relationships in my life not not romantic ones but like friendships I guess I've lost a lot of friends just because of the type of way I am this is the first relationship I've had it's actually like long-term and serious and I kind of wish I never go into it in the first place because of just how I feel right now love hurts it sucks and you always think everything's going to be okay but then it's not on there because everything comes crashing down she been like this for the past month to be honest but only it got really serious these past few days because I decided to bring up why he's been acting so off and weird Nia found out I'm lost for words now so I guess I'm just glad here but um that's just what's going on right now and I just don't know what to do and myself because I have no life outside of this relationship this is my life my entire life revolves around this and now if it goes I have absolutely zero things to fall back on nothing else me I just realized nothing else even makes me happy because except when I see something that's like slightly funny than it might make me smile or laugh quickly but nothing makes me truly happy like this just like you know whenever I go to visit my family like I'm just like oh I just want to go home yes I like seeing my actual family of course I love my family so much but they can't help me right now they can't fix us they can't make this better talking to them just know just gets me nowhere because they're trying to give me advice and I don't think they really like him pick us up the way I've been treated lately but so it's like they have a biased opinion I don't want somebody has a biased opinion I don't want somebody that's going to like be against him you know who I mean any somebody is not biased and everyone's biased because they want the best for me and they think that I should deserve better and just move on to somebody else's something like that and it's for the best but no you don't you don't really know me and I think anyone really does like to a big enough except nobody knows me to a big enough extent at all nobody can ever be inside my mind and I understand my thoughts and shit so I don't want anyone's advice actually yeah I don't want anyone's help or advice here because it's not gonna do anything I'm just not gonna follow people's advice if they tell me that I should just move on and leave like fuck that right now just fuck it good anyway I guess like yeah if I was trying to throw my family just I'm I can't exist there anymore I only exist here I can't exist anywhere else I don't want to lose my freedom because I just love being able to be here and just have so much freedom to do ever I want 101 I'll lose all of that if I not here anymore at him I constantly crave his love an attention I can't get it for anyone else so yeah that's it really and hopefully when I talk to you again I'll be better that I don't know what's going to happen for now thanks for watching and I'll see you guys soon	Character count: 14412 | Duration in seconds: 1264 | Characters per second: 11.4

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9cvEKptcJI	suicidal	Suicide is the only option!?	you know some people will never understand what it's like to be at your breaking point a point where you feel the only way for you to escape this insufferable pain is ceasing to exist [Music] some people can't believe to the some people have their religious beliefs in booze and they can't see outside of that I was against suicide at one time believe it or not you know people never want to die they just can't find a solution to the pain and they want to escape sometime people feel like they've exhausted all of their options and I think that a lot of times in life we want to believe that there is a solution to every situation a fairy tale story and ending but the fact of the matter is some things are incorrigible every situation you cannot repair every situation and thing is not fixable [Music] and I think once people are able to understand that first they will begin to see while suicide is a option for certain people well but at least begin to understand the state of mind that individuals are in when they consider such things it bothers me sometimes people say they can't relate to other people with shoes and some situations you know I don't want to generalize here and make general statements because some of this is circumstantial but some situations really are not hard to understand and I don't think that you have to be in those situations to be able to understand the level of pain that a person is in dori example some people ignorantly tell me J I don't understand what it's like to have very severe anxiety you know you can't expect me to understand I can't believe it I don't have it bullshit everybody has anxiety at some point in time in their life the only thing that separates my anxiety from yours is that I have a disorder he mental illness which means that my anxiety occurs more frequently it's more intense and it occurs in situations in which it shouldn't occur that's what makes it a disorder where you guys have normal anxiety you may experience anxiety when you're preparing for tests and college are really important to us that's gonna help to you know help you earn your degree but if your doctor called you in and told you that they had who are running MRI because they feel it may be some something cancerous in your breasts or tell you that you may have a fatal disease and you have to come in to the doctor's office to receive the results wherever your mother father were loved one was in a severe accident and an emergency-room notified you of this and told you that they're in critical condition and may die the level of devastation can you not imagine that I'm sure you can't show you've experienced something on that level what person would ends ID we filled this every day for no logical reason the only logical reason for it is that we have a chemical imbalance but outside of that there is not always a particular trigger or realistic reason we just have anxiety disorder and so we we don't think rational all the time our anxiety lies to us and can convince us to believe anything no matter how outlandish or unrealistic it may be it's to the point your anxiety can convince you that when you go to bed at night you're silly that's gonna fall down one you your anxiety allows you to be become intimidated and terrified of things that without the anxiety you you you wouldn't be it places importance on the smallest things it makes you terrified of some of the smallest things it makes you believe some of the most unlikely things things that you know are not true but the anxiety still has a way of making you fare these things of thoughts or ideas and situations imagine somebody telling you that you have to live the rest of your life and a hundred and twenty degrees weather imagine somebody put your hand to a a hot scorching stove and told you that you have to live the rest of your life like that would you not wanna die would you not take dying over that yeah you would some people have lost loved ones and lost family members and the love of their lives people have post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from abuse where they have nightmares constantly about orbit terrifying things some people cannot control what goes through their mind what comes in their mind and they're they're being tortured mentally by different intrusive thoughts that's in their head these are sick people and I don't think that mental health community gets enough attention gets enough love it's not enough people out there that that's supporting us and helping us to fight our diseases so that we can live a productive comfortable life while you guys are struggling with basic things such as jobs and money career relationships we're struggling to just be normal it affects and impacts every aspect of our life and while people may think you know go to therapy you know take some medicine psychiatric medicine that doesn't always work unfortunately it's not that simple economy can take a long long time to find the combination of therapy methods and and medicine that is effective in treating your illness because everybody reacts to different medicines differently and even once you find that perfect combination it still may not help you enough to function at the level that you would like to or to enjoy life the way you would want the fact that it matter is most people with mental illness it gets worse they don't get better so you keep trying and trying and trying to to hang on but your life every day you wake up from the time that you go to sleep consist of Tara it's a mental struggle and battle that you face with every time that you open your eyes we don't know what's after death Christian's obviously believe there's heaven in hell there's no proof of that but that's what their God said on this with the Bible tell them unless we believe they're right to believe that I believe Muslims believe that there's paradise and I think they believe in Hell so it was some form of hell most people who may not be religious believe that there's just nothing it's just darkness light can be good it can really be good but sometime life can be like this just dark assertive people cast in pain constant heartache unbearable pain and unless you are dealing with this every day unless you got hot fire to your ass every day you are not in position to tell someone that they are weak for killing themselves because despite what you may believe for some of us that truly is the only answer live a life full of insufferable pain or die and sometime I'll rather take complete blackness being unconscious where I don't know nothing I don't feel nothing I don't see nothing sometimes yes I'll be content with that and we'll take bad over living life and suffering day in and day out	Character count: 6721 | Duration in seconds: 822 | Characters per second: 8.2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-K-6r0mSMA	suicidal	How to commit suicide. (How to kill yourself)	now don't get mad at what I named this video okay yes this was meant to drawing you in if you looked up that title don't change though do not change it there's a lot of other videos like this and the things they say are ridiculous saying it you're thinking of suicide don't do it there's so much to live for it's so much potential and these people have no idea what's going on in your life I mean they don't know what it's like to wake up every morning and as soon as you open up your eyes you just think my god I'm still alive damn it every morning when I wake up I deal with this as soon as I open up my eyes this feeling of just depression and emptiness and sorrow just hits me it's just BAM I'm still alive shoot and a lot of people don't understand what suicide is people don't understand what it's like to be a suicidal um one day and so many things could cause you to be suicidal um most of the time it's loneliness as far as someone who's been dating and you know it's been proven women's standards are so high nowadays and they have no standards for themselves so it's so hard for men to find a woman that the suicide when you look at um what caused the suicides you'll see lots of times in men it's because there's no good women out there and the men men need a woman and women are just so mean and just badmouth men all the time and emotionally destroy men men can't take the pain and that's what suicide is about it's about no matter whether it's that or something else it is about stopping the pain people think it's about making people feel sorry for you and I've heard people talk about suicide like oh I'm too strong for suicide how stupid that person would be to kill themselves like oh I'm gonna kill myself and make everyone make everyone else feel bad for what they've done to me in Beaubourg love is listening this guy not just laughing I was like wow you are so stupid for thinking that that's what suicide is about it's about stopping the pain it's about not being able to take it anymore and it just becomes too much and for a lot of you people that are suicidal you could be in a room with a lot of other people that are suicidal and all actually understand the same feeling that you're all going through but still be alone and still feel alone now in my case besides the loneliness and knowing that I'll be alone for the rest of my life it's also also a chemical disorder and that's what I just have to deal with and people it's so funny when people hear you're suicidal they think that you're gonna hurt other people and I kind of laugh at that's like well actually the exact opposite I want to help people they don't accept my help and I think what's the point of being around anymore if people will not change for the better and not help themselves do not learn people are so stubborn in their ways and they try and prove what they want to believe instead of trying to find facts and believe the facts and that's where it comes from for me but there's so many different reasons I I know people oh gosh I keep myself together I know people who've lost absolutely everything I got my very best friend since I've had oh well not best for anymore uh but he's still good friend close friend since I was 19 and I lived with this gentleman for a while and he lost his kids and he lost his house he lost his business he lost his business he lost everything and I was going to court at the time and I almost got about 20 years and then his brother came in and lived with us and what you had you had a big huge beautiful house with a big pool in the backyard and a waterfall and a jacuzzi and the most expensive toys the guy was a millionaire you you had a bachelor pad with three guys and we were all suicidal and we only had each other and the only thing that kept us from doing anything to ourselves was knowing that the other two would have to live with that and the suicide is a selfish act yes but believe it or not people around you if you were to do such a thing you will put such a toll on for the rest of their lives I was about to finally do it and actually this isn't stuff right here I went out to get these pills and now all the pharmacies were closed and and for some reason with my phone when I sitting and something on the phone I would I could look up the pharmacy to make sure they're open hit the call button and it would not detect my finger and then I would call someone else and it would call but no matter what pharmacy it was all the pharmacies as soon as I hit touch call all of a sudden it no longer detected my finger and I dealt with it for about two hours and I called every single number that night except the pharmacies numbers and then at the at the end of the night I realized it was my best friend's birthday and I realized if I had done it for the rest of my life my best friend would remember on his birthday this is the day that my best friend Justin killed himself and I would have ruined that for the rest of his life and you see there's people out there who you don't know this but if you were to kill yourself there are people out there who will blame themselves and maybe people you don't even know very well and when I talk even off signs and people start really realizing that I wasn't really mentally stable and they saw that I had suicidal tendencies that's when people start telling me if I were her myself they would they would feel it for the rest of their lives and I know that if I were to do something right now and I'm get rid of my family just I couldn't care my family but now I know if I did do something right now my family I mean parents and sisters stuff like that I don't have a wife or kids I wish I had a kid oh god that'd be great but anyway um if I were to do that now I know there's at least five people and I guarantee you that if you know anyone it just just the fact that you exist there be people who would regret it and you know honestly people go against you and people turn on you make it sound like you're psychotic and that you're Psychopaths or anything because you may be suicidal but if you are suicidal I've thought about anything and that's growing in your mind and it's becoming a romantic idea and passionate idea and then it gets to the point where this is it this is where you know it's bad as it when it's to the point where you have to hold yourself back and you have to keep yourself from committing suicide cause you know what's gonna happen to people around you and that's the only reason you hold on and that's when it's bad is you're trying not to commit suicide you know every day you wake up you just think I cannot make it today I hate this damned life I hate it and usually it's because of other people I live in a very bad area with a lot of evil people and it's just it just destroys day there's no one else here nobody for me they're all in Los Angeles and the Internet is a great tool because even though I'm not there with you physically and whoever you are and I don't care about beliefs I wouldn't care if you're a Muslim or if you're gay or uh if you voted for Obama but honestly when someone's suicidal you got to put everything else aside you know what I mean because the thing is we're all yeah we're all human beings and we all really need to help lift each other up because we're the only thing that we have when you look at it and today human beings hate human being so much and I've seen so much hatred on the internet and I've been known to make my own videos against people such as freely and I do that first certain purpose being I really didn't it's not that I hate her or anything but I got a purpose behind things that I do against the people who are spreading hateful messages but the thing is when it comes down to it human beings aren't the only thing human beings have and there's so many things separating us nowadays and so many people who are looking for reasons to separate us from any type of religious beliefs any type of political belief and this comes down to people want to prove that they're right instead of looking for facts and following facts and this is causing so much division within different beliefs that people feel alone and I'll let you know right now the Internet has a lot to do with it because even though it's used as a tool when you put your emotions out there and you put yourself out there on Facebook in you make yourself more vulnerable so that's one thing that advises not to do that that's actually a study that was done and I realized that when I put things out there a lot of people and when you when you give your your feelings to people as far as how you feel a lot of people grab it turn around use it against you so that's one problem ah there's just so many things out there that are contributing it today but if anyone's feeling anything I just call me alright I can't can't they call me leave me a message please and if you have anything gets under my videos just put that aside and and just talk to me anyway I understand you're a human being I don't care about anything that you've done in the past and I don't care about your religious or anything like that I will not mind anything that you tell me I've had people tell me things when I was in ministry as far as murdering and stuff like that and it shows me I know I've been told the crazies of the craziest things and if you want to be able to tell someone something that no you know it won't go anywhere and you need someone to talk to I'm here and as much as it sounds funny even though I don't know you I do love everyone and I will let you know I love you whoever you are if you are feeling anything at all as far as any darkness are things going on with your parents or things going on with a spouse whether you're a guy with your girl no matter what race you are no matter where you are on this planet they just me personally I'm a Christian and I just pray that the leveller to touch you right now and that the Holy Spirit can just come down right now and touch you and I just pray that you're able to feel comfort at this time and feel loved and that you're able to get clarity right now and well that's it that's just a simple prayer I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna go ahead and leave this video with this so y'all thank you for watching this video y'all be blessed I love you all so

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SJywvgaJEI	distress	Watch This Video When You’re Feeling Down	hey guys I'm currently in New York for the creator summit and I always love this event because it's an opportunity for me to talk to a bunch of other creators that I don't normally get to talk to and I think a common theme during this one is that we're all starting to realize that we're human I mean it's a it's common knowledge that youtubers try to compete to see who can be the most hardworking person out there but but I always enjoy taking the time to talk with people personally not about YouTube not about how how the numbers are doing but how they're doing in their life and like I said one of the common themes is that we all have points where our creativity breaks down a bit we all have points so self-doubt and we all have points of just where we're feeling low in life so I wanted to make a video to kind of convey some knowledge because I'm actually doing I'm actually doing really well right now I'm in a good place in my life I feel I feel fulfilled creatively and I feel like I'm on the path to doing something more and that that's owed largely in part to the fact that I'm not taking everything so seriously as I used to I'm trying to be more like myself I'm trying to be more open about my feelings but I also wanted to make a video that you guys could watch if you're ever feeling low and you're ever feeling like the world is coming down around you first and foremost is that it is absolutely okay to feel down it's absolutely okay to feel sad you don't have to put up a front of happiness you don't have to put up a fake wall of doing fine you can be real about your emotions you can you can be honest with yourself and you can be honest with those around you you don't have to worry about burdening those around you with your sadness you don't have to internalize it always and number two you have to identify what it really is that's causing your sadness we've had a few speakers here at the creator summit one of them was Erik Barker who was talking in great length about how success measures towards happiness and a lot of it you know isn't a competition between happiness and success it's it's about using those two things in conjunction with each other now you feeling down maybe the result of someone bullying you or the result of you bullying yourself and one of those things is something that you can change and one of those things is something that you can try to change you know others bullying you is a problem of the environment that you're in and the steps to be taken to change that or harder than one might think but even harder than that are the steps to stop bullying yourself which is the one thing that you definitely can change but probably the one thing that we all do more than anything else so identifying if your depression or your sadness is coming from a place of internal hate is something that plagues a lot of us and and also it's it's not something that needs to be fixed right away some some of us get down on ourselves I can me myself included because we expect so much out of ourselves you know we want to do so much therefore we're upset when we do less and that's a poisonous way of thinking and it's a poisonous like a route to take yourself down because it only means that you don't celebrate your successes enough and you only admonish your failures and that's no way to live so if you're if you're ever feeling this way just remember that you you can choose to forgive yourself for transgressions you can choose to forgive yourself for failures you can choose to be above your own hate and take that as an example for the hate in the world around you a lot of bullying these days are people that are projecting their own hate on themselves upon others so that they can escape their pain and you know that's no way to live but that's someone else's problems if you're feeling down about yourself then many times you just need to forgive yourself but there's also environmental factors that aren't you being mad at yourself for being upset with yourself they're their situational things money's not enough you know your home life isn't solid here your your relationships are breaking down you don't feel like you have friends to surround yourselves with and in those times I don't have an anecdotal piece of advice or words that are gonna fix your problem or even likely to make you feel better but if it does bring you any solace just know that I really honestly truly believe that you can get through it i honest believe that you're strong enough to pursue your goals and to conquer your dreams and go farther than you ever thought possible but the only way to do it is to keep trying no matter what no matter what gets in your way no matter what adversity you face if you keep trying if you never give up if you always pursue that thing which makes you happier the thing that makes you burn inside you for the the ambition that you have the projects that you see on the horizon the dreams that you hope to achieve if you keep your eye on them and not just on the dream itself because if you obsess about the dream and what it will mean when you get there you'll ignore all of the obstacles on the path like really focus on the whole picture of everything if you're trying to do something and you're constantly met with failure or your friends don't believe in you or your family doesn't believe in you then those are obstacles that are on your path to your goal and you need to see the whole picture you need to realize that that some dreams carry a heavy price but if they're worth it then nothing can stop you and this is something that's pushed me to where I am today that's something that's gotten me where I am because when I started YouTube or when I started just in general wanting to take control of my life I looked at the entire road ahead of me or as far as I could possibly see and I was been with more obstacles than I ever could have imagined but what it took and what I realized right away was it took sacrifice and it took Drive and it took unyielding passion and it took sleepless nights and it took lost friends and it took fake friends and it took my parents not believing in me it took it took and and after I pushed beyond that I started to gain the recognition that I was right all along and it's it's not as simple as that but that's what it boils down to so if you're feeling low are you feeling down or are you feeling like you're not succeeding in life or you're feeling like those around you aren't supporting you just remember that I believe in you and that everyone here in the comments believes in you and that we're all in the same boat together and we can all succeed if we just believe in each other and believe in ourselves so anyway I gotta get down we've got more events today thank you everybody so much for watching and as always I'll see you in the next video bye bye	Character count: 6870 | Duration in seconds: 452 | Characters per second: 15.2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aW2rgdkCwM	distress	Forced to be Raped Or Drowned (Real Life Story Time)	hi you guys I am here today with something a little different I apologize for the bone makeup I just got through recording like three other videos so yeah and if you're wondering why I have the same shirt on in this video it's because I'd be like multiple videos in this state and there's something that has been on my mind for a while now like I've been contemplated making this video just because I know it's a lot of sickos out there I didn't want to give any signals out there any idea of an horrible horrible thing to do to someone else but just so other people could be aware that things like this happen I decided to go ahead and share it with you guys Jerry Richard eyes so this story takes place I want to say when it was it was when I was a teenager I was about 16 or 17 I was a virgin at the time so me and two of my sisters have I'm not sure anyone else was there but I think it was shit me and two or three of my sisters at the beach again we were there having a fun time Miami our business it was a really hot day so it was like a bunch of people at the beach on that day we were playing alone I can't remember what we were playing we were probably like dunking each other for something because we were like attractive females men will always come up to us talk to us play with us all of that in this particular day like at the moment no one was coming up to us and we was having the time of our life so there was these guys they were like playing a game believe it or not like you guys this is the realest Beach getting you guys finally ever heard that it actually looked it's fun so they were throwing like keys they had like a bunch of keys on a green and they were like doing it back and forth and reaching down dumping down in the water getting the key ring and all of that so even let they follow we said they'll be watch them then we went back to playing so when they got done with that game they just came over to us talking to us mingling with us and some of them was teenagers and some of them were grown men like groaning and then all of a sudden I think one of the boys had dumped my sister and then for now you know we were teenagers so we just started a whole game and it was fun I'm not going to lie I'm not gonna downplay that so we were playing and everything and one of the taller guys he was about 6 to 2 6-4 he was really tall like best about player town now this was one of the grown man I want to say he was probably between ages of 22 and 25 and like I said before I was a teenager to time I was like 16 and 17 so he was talking to me my sister's was talking with other guys and other people he pulled me aside and said he wants to talk to me my dude the whole time we are in the water so I'm probably about I'm 5 2 and the water is probably right underneath my breasts at this point that's as deep as I am comfortable with going just because I'm short in at the time I did not know how to swim so we went over to the side and it wasn't even that far like I want to say we were about 20 feet away from my sister noon and we were off to the right but the thing is it was not much people on the right side of the beach so we're over there talking and all of a sudden he grabbed me he dumped me I splashed and we're playing friendly and he was trying to talk to me and I kind of you know getting the cold shoulder because he was a lot more older than what I was used to then I was only 16 or 17 at the time but so I was not used to talking to like grow me and if they weren't grown big like 18 but like 24 it was like push me so he kept dancing for my number and everything and I came up we all talk excuses like my home is all this that and the other and just giving him the cold shoulder and I just want to talk to him and not a friend because I didn't know the guy but I just want to have small talk with him and everyone else but he insisted that he pulled me to the side so we're playing splashing each other and all the time he like really like no life he grabbed me by my waist and he was like walking back slowly and I'm like okay I'm ready didn't look at it as a problem right then and there he had around my waist and then when he went to when a water got to like about here I'm like come on let's go back like we're going too far I can't swim and he still was just walking back and I'm trying my best I got kind of serious with the guy like let me go let me go like I can't swim pulling me beat and he was like I got you I got you and I say I don't feel comfortable with being back this far because I like I just kept telling Mike actually on my kiss won't let me go the guy were not so he grabbed me he just going back back back and at this point I'm pretty sure the water is over my head but he had me in he had me by the way he's holding me up so they never went over my head but if he let me go the water will be well over my head but not for him because he was like much taller than me like much holiday in whole time of Chancellor with this man telling him to let me go my sister is on a whole other they were busy talking and mingling with the other people that I don't even think they'd notice what was going on so this is where they get a little difficult if you are under the age of I'm gonna say sixteen this will be a good time for you to exit the video but before you leave I'm gonna tell you don't trust anyone and if someone tried to pull you into the seat do not let them scream that's one of the things I regret not screaming but to be honest even if I scream because everyone was far over to the left I don't think anyone would I heard me but it would have been good if I would and he probably was meant for me not to because he probably let me go and things gonna go up uh I couldn't drown to make a long story short so yeah it's gonna get a bit this blizzy to say so if you are under the age of 16 please exit this video now so once he got me to the deep I'm really really really not comfortable with sandals like you're not gonna cry you're not gonna try it forever you are not sent to crack so once he got me to the deep he got to feeling on me I don't even know like I want to get into details like is that traumatic to me about how to if I'm gonna tell the story all the way I have to get into details so he started filming down there with his hands and stuff and it's really hard like even to just get the words out it's like really difficult for me so just bear with me so he was putting his finger on a place you'd like you gotta kind of over me and it's hard but I'm saying something like I am now like I know what it feels like to be choked up because that's exactly what I'm experiencing right now not today not today I'm not gonna cry look anyway you got to fill in places with his hand and stuff and he pulled my swimwear over to the side oh I like you guys i I just feel like I'm gonna melt right now like it's like I'm reliving the moment telling me but I'm only going to tell this just so you guys can be aware of these types of people so um he moved my swimwear at the bottom over to the side and he took hits oh my god he took his private part out or whatever got the rubbing in places and stuff and he tried to what's his stuff in moody too sad tries to force itself in and thankfully thank God I was a virgin at the time he fought and pride and pride he tried his best like he was so good since they tried to Jesus my heart is like racing right now to try to enter into me to faith and it just wasn't working it wasn't fitting thank God and he did that for probably 15 minutes and after then I guess he kind of gave up and mind you there was nothing I could do because I couldn't swim I so I just had to sit there and go through it like and then I was I was yelling but I was more so focused on trying to get him trying to convince him to talk to him and try to convince him to take me back to shore or you know at least where the water is an unsafe position so in-between me yelling and calling for my sister's I was trying to convince this man to take me back so he tried for a whole 15 minutes and God must have been with me because it didn't go in he tried and tried and tried in the track and he just wouldn't go in st. God but even though nothing went in nothing just that touching me and rubbing and kissed it and completing his finger places like I I still consider it sexual assault like to the fullest so thank God he gave up after like 15 hold minute when t minutes like literally and he started welcome back a short me now one thing I am glad about instead he didn't you just drop me cuz I wanna definitely drown no one could hear me no one was right there I would have died more than likely so lovely he did walk me back to shore in a moment I got like two here with the water punch the man I kicked away from like I kicked him and kicked off against him and I ran I don't want to say well because I couldn't really run in water if that makes any sense but I got away from that man as fast as I could like it's fast as I could I also thank God that he didn't try to get aggressive back with me because if he wanted to chase me or catch up with me definitely couldn't have because he had longer less because he was taller but he'd be end up like actually passing me up like thank God he wasn't coming after me so he called up he kind of went as I'm moving fast you know walking through the water it's hard trading or walking through water and it just felt like I was going through slow motion like it just felt like forever so he kind of passed me up and he'd beat me to shore because his last was much longer he knew how to swim and he was much taller and all of that so him in his guys they just kind enough fast like they were already where the blocker rooms was by the time I got out of the water like I couldn't see them no more they were gone they didn't wash up in the outside shower or nothing I'm not sure if they went into the locker rooms because at the interesting you can't really tell so I don't really know I just know they went around where the locker room was that so I don't know if they love me or if they went in the locker / bathroom or not but you guys I'm not even sure if I told my sisters I have to ask them because I'm not even sure if I even told them I was just so hysterical I didn't even called the police like I'm scared like I know this sounds crazy but like to explain a situation like right now even like years later it's hard for me to say so calling the police like it's a stranded old and living over-bright up there having able to be like so tough however if he were to enter me I wouldn't I'm gonna have a choice I would have been on and called the police but because he didn't I just hysterical I was ready to go I went up to my sister's crying they pregnant even know I was crying but I don't know how can you tell I was crying because I had water all over me but if they would have been paying attention to my body my body language they definitely would have known that I was crying so I was just so ready to go like I just got my opinions got my sisters and we left I did not see the guy on the way out he just was gone so yeah that's my story time on how I was forced to be drowned or grate right you guys you have so much your surround this at all times and from from my experience I learned not to like talk to the mill a man and know like always make sure you have someone like don't walk off from everyone else cuz sometimes people are so busy communicating playing and all of that stuff that they cannot really they're not really aware I was going on we chewing someone else and now some sick go some some some lowlifes who will try to take advantage of you young Oh whatever just make sure you're never alone and that's one and that's like a big thing in my life like even right now to this day like I do not like to be by myself like I always try to make sure I have at least one other person daily or you know like Alexis the daytime if it's nighttime I definitely don't like to be alone sometimes I'm okay with being alone in the daytime even though this event occurred in a day time but just just never be alone if you can help it and if someone wants to pull you out to the side if you don't know them don't do it don't unless it's like a lot of people around other than that don't do it so yeah I really hope I told you guys something someone somewhere I hope I definitely learned my lesson but I hope I could you know open your eyes to not trust so easily and to not let someone pull you off to the side or try to take advantage of you and I hope I save someone from being a break just and I hope I let you informed you guys that just because it's daytime just because there's a lot of people around doesn't mean they're pedophiles or whatever you want to call them sickos rapists doesn't mean that they won't try to take advantage of you so be very aware they tell people around not just be very aware of your surroundings your situations that you put yourself in or that's how one tried to put you in and yeah that's about it I hope you guys enjoy it MSI bye	Character count: 13113 | Duration in seconds: 987 | Characters per second: 13.3

closer closer baddest point I'm scared cuz what I'm thinking he's about to do I'm because they play a lot my brothers and his friends they played a lot so I'm thinking they was outside of the patio listening and so I'm thinking that they were about to run in like he was about to grab me and they were all about to run in and carry me and dump me in the water it happened before something similar so you know I'm like I was scared say you know I'm backing up but the way that the kitchen was it was now out only one out like you who can only go out one way boy I'm by the refrigerator like you

but I'm saying though if you don't want me to go out there I want that's on my head on my as he's walking closer to me he's like but no seriously I'm sorry and I'm like okay you said that so now what I feel like he was doing he was planning something but I didn't know what it was I knew he was planning something for sure but I just didn't know it was he was walking so close and I feel like he was talking I feel like he was talking to break the awkwardness of him walking towards me you know what I mean it was so here yeah I didn't know it was so easy he finally got towards me to me he finally got close to me Maji he's talking to me I don't know I wasn't like 14 so Ashley's getting closer to me he goes like this lifts up my chin and goes like this okay and he's like okay as if to say like

shook as she's holding my chin he's like but I did see the way that you was looking at my eyes when I was looking at you I'm like what what are you talking about guys look I was looking into his eyes but that's beside the point mind you all of all of my oh my my brother and his friends are still outside of this apartment like any one of them can walk in slide that patio door open and just you know see what is going on so that's why I'm like it's still a joke but I'm like I don't know so I'm just like so I just kind of move his hand I'm like it's okay and he grabs my hand cuz mind you this is after he said I saw the way she was looking at my eyes so I'm just like I just tell him I like it's okay and I just moved his hand I mean like yeah move his hand and he's he grabbed something by my hand and kisses me now y'all a 14-year old me I was ready to bust open no okay let me be serious cuz this is this kind of intense like for you um but yeah you know 14 year old me I didn't know I'm like you know I'm just I didn't know what to say I'm sitting here and I'm just like I I don't know like you know I didn't know what to do so he just kissed me and I'm just like my mouth is just like open I'm just like it's like I don't know it seemed like the moment was happening so long fast-forward it was like I have to talk to you Mike okay talk he's like in private I'm like nobody's in here we're in the kitchen everybody else is outside feel like you know what I mean like he was telling me he wants to go to the room because he was afraid that one of my brother's gonna walk in whatever case you see but whatever the case and he loved a block so we get inside of the room at this point in time my dad we had like a two apartment bedroom I mean two bedroom apartment so we was in like our room but it was like I didn't I necessarily didn't really stay there I was just there sometimes you know I'm saying I'm like okay so we go in the room and he locks the door and I'm just sitting on the bed like I'm sitting on the bed my dude I'm a little kid this guy is what two years older than me I was about to be 15 he was like a year and a half older than me but anyway so um I'm sitting on bail my yeah he's like so all right so what he's like so I know about you I'm like what do you mean you know about me like what are you talking about he's like I know that you like boys I'm like wait mind you at this time I'm still confused I don't even know that I like bollocks like you just approach yourself put yourself on top of me and you're gonna tell me you know that I like boys tell me when cuz I didn't even know I like boys he's like but between me and you I know that you're gonna keep a secret you keeping the secret to herself that you're not gonna tell them I so he was like he didn't necessarily flat-out say that he liked guys as well but he said that he's been wanting to try something and he's been basically having his eye on me and I was just like um I'm just and I'm sitting I'm just like and so I tell him I remember telling him I'm like my brother is outside and he's like I know I'm like he can walk in any minute what are you talking about and he's like I told him I went to the bathroom that I have to use the bathroom I'm like a number one number two because if you're doing the number one you should have been outside I know he was like you talk a lot and I was just saying I'm like okay and I'm the type of person y'all ever since I've been little ever since I was able to talk to like to flirt with somebody I got this bad habit where I flirt with people and I don't mean to you know what I'm saying like I flirt with I guess I have a I have a very smart mouth so when I'm talking to somebody in a moment if you can tell like you know it's kind of like attention there they might take it as me being flirty but I'm being so serious so I tell him he says you talk a lot and I'm like who gonna stop but you know I'm just destined to meet it's like you know I I don't know I don't mean to it so he's like oh really he's like I could stop you and I'm like huh and so he walks up to me and like he's like cuz I'm like okay I'm about to demonstrate so I'm like this on debate you know but like my feet are like down or like so like like just send down and he comes like this and he goes straight like this and just like pushes me back and just go like this and so start kissing collected I'm just I'm sitting there I'm just like this situations start getting heated and he was like don't be shocked just kissing me back and so I'm like okay and so we started kissing and then my junior I didn't want anything to go any further than it was like you know I I didn't want anything to go any further than it but um it kind of did in mind you we're both in sorts right so it's like shirts off all of that no socks not the only insurance as we were kissing he like started pulling down my trunks I'm the type of person like I don't know what to say in a moment it's like I want you to stop but it's like I've it's like I don't want to say the wrong thing and then you'd be like oh I wasn't trying to do that or you know but I need to start speaking more you know what I mean because I could really get myself in a bad predicament like that yeah he pull it down my swim trunks he um he poured down his swim trunks and like you can tell like the the male was getting like horny and he's like kissing me and I and in my head it's like I'm kissing little bet but I'm thinking like this can't happen like you know what I mean my brother is still outside whatever the case can be and so I'm trying to like push them off me a little bit you know I'm like I'm like this can't he like no it's fine I'm like my brother is outside I'm like not only that no like you know no no he's like he's like it's okay I'm not gonna hurt you I'm like but my brother is outside so in the midst of all this he's like kissing on my neck trying to push them off trying to push them off me and everything and um it was like it was just so much going on I'm trying to push them off me and then y'all know I'm scrawny I'm a little dude I'm five seven and I weigh 135 if that I vary from 125 to 135 I'd be lucky if I reached 135 clearly taller than me bigger than me he's not he wasn't big but he was like bigger than me you know what I mean like he's like I don't know so I'm like trying to push them off me and I'm just like no like you know and so he said he kissing my money a snack Indian I felt him like kind of go underneath like you know to grab his you know you know I felt him like forcing it against me again why Amos and um you know I'm like literally pushing him now like I'm like okay no and so he's just keep going this rocking motion and I'm like someone I knew for a fact it wasn't gonna go in because it was dry he grabs my arms like this pins him down and he he like spits on his hand rubs it down there on his thing spits on the beginning and rubs it on mine and I'm just like oh my god so I'm like no no so be ok and I'm like no like no stop like you know and at this point I'm like I don't want to scream anything you know I don't want to I'm gonna yell Indian like my brother he comes or I don't know it's like yeah I never told anybody this Oh act like my mother acts was I ever touched was I born I always told to know and like it's like a I don't really I don't know it's like I kind of blame myself because I know I couldn't be something different like you know what I mean like I could have really avoided it I don't know but um ok back to the story I'm trying to push them off me and mind you my hands are like a lot above my head so he keeps this rocking motion going and mind you by then it's like it's a wet now so it's like and so I felt it go in now mind you you know like when were you having sex with a person and you you know you okay they might just stick the head in or whatever the case of you know I felt that you go in and like I'm just like I remember I pause for a good 15 second and I just remember um I remember pause them for that 15 seconds and then as he keeps going it was just I was so shocked I was like and then I had Green because it hurt after like I was like and I just yelled and he covered my mouth and was like what the are you doing and I'm like stop I'm like stop this doesn't I'm like it hurts for one I'm like stop No and so he kept it's like he kept going and being act on like please and he stopped and I'm sitting there I'm like indie and that's when I heard my brothers and them coming and I'm laying there on the bed right my brother's coming I can you can hear them from from the room from the patio you could hear them like opening the patio my brother's friend literally sent the trunks back on me so fast and then here we have to pull his trunks on he unlocked the door came towards me act like he was putting me in a headlock and I'm sitting there just like teary-eyed right and my brother he opens up the door he like what are y'all doing and then he's like he like he like re re he was I are he don't want to play no more he don't want to play no more like just leave him alone so my brother was thinking that he was like just messing with me like you know what I mean like how you usually do and so I'm sitting I'm just like my brother was like hey come on we finna leave and we finna go back to such-and-such house I'm sitting here I'm just lying teary-eyed and everything it was it was it was a crazy moment when when everybody got changed and everything they always leaving out of the front door and I remember he came back in the room where I was cuz I never moved he came back in the room where I was and he was like don't tell nobody I'm just lying and to this day I never told anybody I did see him times in times after that but I just never really engaged in conversation or tried to make contact you know like you you know when you do something with somebody and it's a secret so you're trying to kind of avoid them but it was more to it than that it was just like like you know no and I was like no it was times where I would go to my mother house cuz my mother stays two hours away from my dad cuz my dad doesn't stay in Chicago so it was times I come back to my mother's house and he would text me he's like yeah when you coming back to your pops house or whatever catching me I'm like I never I left him already whatever and then um just last year was it last year or was it this year I think it was this year but I'm scrolling on social media and I see that he passed away and it's like I felt I don't know I I was I don't know I don't know how I felt it was just like a bad feeling I felt like I felt weird like I don't know I felt weird and then um cuz you know you I don't know I just felt weird but I most definitely do wish that it didn't happen like that I don't know I don't really include it as rape I don't know I I just I pitch her rape to be like

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNSC3EGcJLE	distress	I had a bad day	Hi everyone TheReportOfTheWeek checking in! And... Here you can see it's a different setting. Reporting in from base from the from the command post (i.e. bed). But uh... Oh man, it's been one of those days, you know, it's been one of those days and I said because originally, right? I was gonna do a review today. It's not gonna happen, that's all that I can tell you. And I thought to myself, I think this would be a good chance to kind of set the camera up, you know, do it maybe a little casually and just try to, you know, just vent it out to you and try to get maybe a little bit of a message across at the same time. Ehh, I mean don't don't even get me started. All right, it was one of those days, you know? You know when just everything goes wrong and you have absolutely no control over the situation whatsoever. One of those days Where, you know, I'm filming this on a Thursday, right? So it's not it's not live, but that's okay - that's an aside. You know, it's Thursday evening. It's around 7:18 p.m. And, for those you that know those of you that don't, every Thursday is the day that I do my radio show. And you know, I call it a radio show. It's really like a glorified podcast. You know? I get it up on the SoundCloud and TuneIn and then it goes out 15 times on shortwave to, you know, the international audience there and this week's show... I mean, I was really feeling it! Like the last few weeks, I wasn't really feeling the best one week. I had some terrible anxiety one week. I had some bad migraines, so I was able to put something together. But, you know, it could have been a little better, but I was just inhibited by just how I was doing physically. This week I was feeling it and I said, you know what? I'm gonna work hard at this. I'm gonna get a good show out for everyone and... And you know? I did. I really put a lot of time into it. I worked for a few days. I actually made the show about an hour longer than it usually is, where I just I had a lot to talk about. Got some good music played and I was just on a roll. I got the show set up. I edited it, you know, I really wanted to promote it too. So I was trying to get the links, you know, to where it it streams on tune in and the shortwave frequencies and listening times to everyone that wrote in, you know? I was working for 8 hours straight. I was getting to about 4 or 500 emails. I was responding and I thought yeah, I mean, I'm really on a roll today. I was feeling this show I'm gonna get it out. I'm gonna get it promoted and I was exhausted by the end of it. You know, I was working through the night finally fell asleep. I woke up just in time for the first broadcast airing to, you know, start checking it out and make sure everything's going all right. And... I'm not hearing in the show! It's just it's it's dead air!! I checked the tune in stream and it's just silence! There's nothing there! I checked the short wave frequency, you know, where the radio station is supposed to be broadcasting it. There's nothing. I'm scratching my head. I'm trying to think. Oh, wait a minute, you know, I I know I sent them the file. I know I, you know, I submitted the show to them. So so what's going on? So I sent the manager of the radio station an email, you know, not not angry, we're on really good terms and I just said, you know, well, you know, "What's going on? Is everything all right with the computers?" You know? I just wanted to check and my my I don't see my show airing. What's uh, what's up? And... Then he broke it to me.He said listen, you know, we we kind of have a problem! Someone hacked into our computer system, deleted or I think encrypted all the files that they had every audio program and then was demanding money to get them restored. And they said, you know, "Look we're dead in the water here!" "We can't even access any of the shows that we're supposed to air. We're not going to give in to this guy's demands!" "So we need to get a whole new computer system set up and unfortunately..." "It's not going to be finalized until maybe maybe tomorrow at the earliest." Which, in short, means that everything that I was working on and promoting and doing over the last few days for this radio show was for nothing! And It was due to circumstances outside my control, outside the control of this radio station. It was just some hacker that decided to screw with them and, you know just try to get a ransom kind of like, you know... You remember those old viruses that used to infect your computer and say it was locked by the FBI? Unless they give him like five hundred bucks? And, you know, that kind of deal same type of thing. I knew that it wasn't my fault. It wasn't the fault of the folks who work at the radio station. They were working to get it fixed. Man, I couldn't help but feel so disappointed. I was I was feeling disappointed. I was feeling down. I was feeling frustrated. I was shaking my head and I was just saying damn it, you know, I spent so much time. So much energy. I was just trying so hard to get a good show out to all these people who were looking forward to it and It's not gonna happen. Yeah, there's a few people that's still tuned in on the SoundCloud. But, I know the tens of thousands of people listen on shortwave and on TuneIn they weren't notified that this was gonna happen. No one knew that it was all gonna go down. And I was just kicking myself. I was just I was just saying, you know, total loss! Just a complete and total loss. I kept kicking myself! Like I kept I just kept beating myself up. Getting down on myself. I was getting into a real I was digging myself into a hole, you know. My mind was just beating me up. It was trying to find a way to blame me for this issue. And... you know, say, "You screwed up! You messed this up!" You know, I was just trying to make me feel like a piece of... "you know what"! And I stopped. I took a deep breath. I stopped and I remembered something and that's why I have the camera on right now. This situation, this problem, is unique to me. But I think in a very broad generalization, we've all had these days. We've all had these problems where something happens to us. Okay, it could be on a personal level. It could be at work, could be at school, could be with family, friends, relationships, business... anything. And something happens, something doesn't go the way that it was supposed to go at all and could end up being a complete failure due to reasons totally out of our control. And.. I know a lot of us have gone through this. You might be going through this right now? I Know I Am. The best thing to do, is to stop! Take a few deep breaths. Just Inhale for a while. Exhale. Just take those slow breaths. That's a good way to just calm your body and especially your mind. And ask yourself this, "This situation is out of my control at this point." "What is my anger, my frustration and my tantruming going to do to solve it?" Look at look at my situation! So these guys hacked into the radio station, they're pretty much extortionists, and what am I gonna do about it? You know, what am I gonna do? The staff at that radio station, they're already working on it! They're already trying to replace the files and get a new security system and computer program updated. They're on it. So... What's my anger gonna do? Yeah, we have every right to be frustrated because it didn't go our way, but we cannot let that get the best of us! Never forget that! If the situation is out of hands, It's out of our hands! Yeah, it's okay to blow off some steam. You got to do it in respectful and appropriate ways though. But if the situation's out of our hands, you just got to ask yourself, "What is all this needless anger and frustration?" "What's it gonna do for me?" "How is it gonna help?" And really the short answer: It's not going to! Best thing to do is to cut the losses as best you can and move on! Just say, "Tomorrow is another day!" It's a blank slate. Yes, what happened today is what happened. But tomorrow is a blank slate - it is what we can do with as we choose. We can pick the pieces back up, put it back together, try and recover from whatever set us back today. Just keep that in mind dear listeners and viewers. We've all gone through a rough day. Sometimes we'll beat ourselves up over it. But, just remember: We're still here! We're still going. It's not the end of the world Situation's out of our hands. We still have tomorrow and lets just keep that going. We don't know what tomorrow is gonna be. Lets just say, "Hey, it might be a better and brighter day ahead!" That's the way I'm looking at it. And, I know, this radio show, it had its setbacks today, I'm not gonna let that get the best of me and I'm gonna put together a darn good radio show for next week too. You want to check it out? You can find it on SoundCloud! soundcloud.com/vorw_radio_int That's all that I have for you. Thank you for listening to my little talk, just kind of venting it to you. And do take care! I'm your host TheReportOfTheWeek.	Character count: 9040 | Duration in seconds: 649 | Characters per second: 13.9
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n5nOEJtrYA	distress	Being ugly : My Experience	so first of all this is my microphone it's quite broken and I'm I've been drinking a lot of this right now so I'm sort of drunk and I'm feeling really down like extremely down and I will tell you why it's cuz my entire life have been treated quite bad I should also say like this is a warning I my English is not that good and I just I feel I feel really alone and I felt like I was gonna search YouTube for people with the same issue as me and that is being really unattractive and I've been having lots of issues with that because every video I come across is with a really attractive or normal person and they have no idea how how it really is so first of all right now I'm putting up quite of a show so if you think that I look pretty good right now it's because I'm doing my absolute best to show you that I look good it's also the cam so first of all my teeths are fucked up and I'm pushing forward my jaw all the time I have extremely much loose skin this is nothing I can do anything about I've been checking this a lot I have so much risk and it make me look terrible I have a big forehead and my hair is making me look really good but if you would take away the hair like I got pretty bad posture have a really big bulky nose and my lower lip is a lot bigger than my higher lip like my higher lip is normal the rest is not so I'm using my hair I let it I'm letting it grow out so it covers and then I use a hat to hide my and my eyebrows everything is like I do not look good I've never in my entire life had anyone telling me I look good if I look from this side like this push forward my jaw maybe on cam I look a little bit better but people in person they see my nose they see my lips they see my tooth they see everything they see this they see that I'm not looking that good I get so much critic and I'm gonna tell you the story of my life how to say it of how I've had it and also I should tell you I maybe not I may look quite bad but there are people that have it hundreds times worse so I'm not comparing myself to the worst of the worst I'm just here to tell my story for though because I know lots of people on YouTube they are like looking on these they're trying to find someone to relate to and they can't because every person in the video is a girl or it's a guy that looks decently alright like he doesn't big nose or big lips or anything he he does it it's always something so let me start off by telling you the story of how I started getting called ugly so I had a very big trouble having friends as younger everyone always avoided me found ways to get rid of me and I saw that they didn't care back then and I got some friends when I was maybe how old was I I think I was Dyke I'm sorry if this takes time it's hard to talk to me about this isn't scripted or anything this is actually real I was around 13 when I got my first serious friends they were I was 13 12 to 13 and they were like 16 to 18 beautiful alpha males and like they were the first ones to start calling me ugly and that was quite a shady neighborhood so it's like they were with my they were with me cuz my mom gave them cigarettes and stuff so they were like my guardian sorta and they were the first people to call me ugly and things went on and I ended up in school I remember the first time I started I was never like caring about girls cars or like me cuz I remember being young they chased around other guys at the schoolyard and they were like pretending like the girls were trying to kiss the boys and the guys were like you and I remember how they all chased each other and no one chased me so I was just standing there being like what the fuck I guess there was something wrong with me I was like the only one at that time that was like oh I sorta wish a girl would chase me but that didn't happen so yeah let's see I should just cut to the chase when I was 15 I started liking girls like being interested in girls and god this is so difficult it is so difficult making because I'm also drunk and I don't really know if I want to make this I'm trying to do this anyway so I was okay wait I need to get into the who okay so I when I was 15 I realized that I wanted to have love in my life I was I was 15 years when I realized I wanted that and like the amount of people that rejected me is astonishing it's there's it's unexplainable I remember I was 15 I went to school I was socially inactive I was I was a bit overweight that's where all this comes from because I was a little bit on the overweight side so I was a bit heavier not much aware but I was heavier and let's see I think the total sum from when I was 15 to 17 was well over for 500 girls that I wrote with that I tried to get into a relationship with and that's not normal girls I've never gone for the normal attractive girls I never I knew from the start like this is they they are not for me they set these standards that are so high they want attractive guys that are smart and funny and everything so I set up like I tried to write with tall with girls I wrote with girls that were overweight that didn't look so good some of them had a big nose like me some had big lips some had shorter here I even wrote with about I think it was like free free girls that were handicapped note this time I was between 15 to 17 years so I was quite young and every single one called me ugly every single one and they some some of them were straight-up honest with it I said that you're not my type or you're ugly that's like you know if someone says you're not my type that's the nicest way someone can say that you're not you're ugly so always heard you're not my type so that's something I heard a lot and after two years I gave up I gave up totally and when I gave up I started to care more about writing with people who had it difficult or sad and like I didn't have it easy and that's when I first met the first girl in my life that wanted to be with me and I spent seven years with that girl and I regret it very much because that was a girl that treated me so badly and was just using me she did every she called me ugly she forced me to walk five to ten meters behind her she'd never hold my hand she never kissed me she never did anything to show appreciation of me she just simply used me and it was not a good relationship she never cared about me she was always angry aggressive and for the first hole fear she didn't really want to be in an actual relationship with me she just wanted to be with me we had sex and we had fun I guess sorta except when we went outside when I was forced to go behind her and then we went into a relationship and she did everything for I think it was three or four years she forgot my birthday she was cheating on me she was flirting with other guys online she was I always did everything I could when I gave her 20 minutes massages on her back every day even though I was sick I am sick in my body as well like I'm not gonna take that up right now because it's not that major but back then it was when it sort of started so I was not really feeling that well I was weak I was I but I gave it my all I tried to be a good boyfriend I gave him massage i I bought her presence when I had money I spent my time with her I altered my personality for her so she wouldn't feel that it was very weird I tried my best to be the perfect I could and she always told me you're not enough or like you're not good enough or things like that she always told me that and this is how it was for about 3 years or 4 3 4 years then I moved and she didn't move with me she was like it's not worth it if you move it's over so I moved it was over then she started calling me and being like you should take me back because you are unlovable I remembered those words so clearly you are unlovable that's the worst thing I ever felt and I was like screw this nope and I was alone in a cabin in in the middle of nowhere in the woods it's a movie I know but I was literally living in a cabin I have an actual video of it when I recorded like back then because I have other youtube channels this is a new thing but like doser for game and gaming and stuff like that anyway I was living in a cabin for four to five months all and she called me it was after like a few weeks the first no she was like take me back you're unlovable you should be with me I was like nope and I met that's the first time I started writing again with New Year's it it had been three years or almost four I had lost weight I had started exercising more I was a bit stronger things were a little bit easier like living and I was also developing my alcoholic problem I mean you can say alcohol because it's not that bad but like I was drinking a lot anyway I lived in that cabin and I'm started writing with new people in my area which was really not many I had to like take the closest town it was an hour away but like I managed to find a girl there by that time I met her we were just friends it was chill she was actually a terrible human being she was like she only cared about money how people look she wanted to have a guy that took care of of her and all that so I I didn't really feel anything for her we were just friends but in the end she was 17 and I was 20 so it wasn't it was like sorry I mean yeah so like I remember I bought lots of alcohol to her and she was like keep some of this we're gonna use this later and so I kept some of it and she'd done one time visited me in the woods she spent her night with me and we laughed we drank we had fun and we had sex and that's the first time I felt accepted in like I felt like I had hope in my life I really felt like there is hope for me like there's someone for everyone I really felt like there are people that will look past your appearance and that's order right there are people out there who will past how you look and we will be with you even if you're unattractive and it doesn't even matter to what degree of unattractive you are because there will be girls that will not really care the problem is finding them which is the I would say that depends on the country if you're in a country with extremely lots of tourism extremely good economy everyone are decently rich like everyone are decently beautiful all that maybe it's time to look into future plans and move to another place where you can find more unattractive people because that's sort of what you want anyway this girl and I was friends a few weeks and whore were well friends with benefits and then we sort of broke contacts and stuff she was one of those people that were like I get bored of people easily so it was like yeah so we didn't really stay friends anyway after after that time I sort of got really annoyed of being alone and my ex wanted to come come and visit me the girl I was with for all those years that treated me so bad and I was so weak so I said okay and I spent another free or it was about four years I've spent seven in total we first so it was about three more years with her and those here sorta improved quite a lot there were a lot better than the first three years so it wasn't that bad but it didn't work out because I was so unhappy I was extremely unhappy I felt like we had nothing calm and she was always angry moping complaining and she didn't feel good and I didn't feel good we were just tearing each other down and I couldn't forget all all the things in the past and like we had nothing in common except just being angry on each other so we broke up and with that was about five months ago now and I move past everything quite easily so one month ago after we broke up I started to try and date again and the bombardments of you are ugly or not my type was so unreal I can tell you a few things that I've been through I've met people that are extremely girls that are extremely overweight and don't look well as a well as well and they tell me you're not my type you're way too ugly or dim they make up an excuse like oh you didn't text me the same day I can't be free I can't have you as a contact and they'd do anything to get rid of you and then there was this time when I had a date with a girl and I had spent lots of money on making a perfect day together like I had setup everything perfectly and I went on the subway over an hour and I stood on the train on the train station and I looked for her for two hours before I was like okay she gave up and then I went home and she wrote that when she saw me I was so ugly she didn't have the encouragement to talk to me and now I made an algorithm for a site that's like tinder but it's called PADO it's like tinder pretty much where I automatically love every person no matter who it's like a special algorithm for a program that I made so that I click a button and it likes 600 people every day which was double limit and it's I've done that for over 10 days so that's I know easily it's over 6,000 people that I have liked on that side like like and wants to write with no I'm not a single one has responded not a single one even though I put on the best photos I can find not a single soul wants to reply or write or give it give a person like me a chance so where am i standing this alright now extremely depressed extremely sad feeling like giving up I have sort of given up a lot on many things and all these events through the years have made that I haven't been able to live a normal life because my friends were commenting on me not looking good my family's been commenting on it everyone's always pointing it out and I get so frustrated sad when people look away the early no we don't want to get like you as my girlfriend like and I'm I'm currently in a situation where I'm waiting for plastic surgery because that's the only way and I'm telling you this right now if you're unattractive the only way for you to get a normal life is to work earn money or go to the hospital get psycho inside psychiatric help and if it's a weird severe enough they will give you free surgery or whatever get the surgery so you look better it doesn't you don't have to be a model just get the floss out get the big issues cuz if you have a if you especially if you're a guy this is also a gang problem because if you are a girl it doesn't really matter how you look is there's so many guys like me or in a similar situation there's so many of us unexplainable amount there are I've written and talked with so many guys in the same situation as me where they have either a few flaws or many interface that they don't look that terrible but like it's severe enough that it this issue comes up so if you're a girl you can find these guys there's no problem and you don't even have to look good I've written with so many handicapped girls girls who have even bigger flaws in their appearance than me and everything they have no problem at all any girl can find any guy anytime they want no issues whatsoever this guy problem because there is less supply of Karastan girls because girls are the one that use the guys not the other way around unless you're really attractive now I mean in general so this is a guy problem and if you're a guy if you don't look good get surgery only way get surgery if you if you have the possibility to lose some weight or or get muscles about it the only thing and I don't say that to be rude I just said that's my conclusion because this is something I've been suffering with for [Music] about 11 years I think if not more 11 years I've been suffering with this I've never in my entire life garden a single compliment that's been real everyone has always just used me I've heard so many times you're funny you're doing this and that that's nice like personality is one thing when it comes to love at least for me in the place I live only matters how you look so get get surgery if you can I'm repeating myself because I'm running out of things to say and this is probably the only video I can ever do right now if by any chance you guys will like this whoever watches it if even anyone watches it I don't know I don't know hope it goes better for you I hope you can sorta relate to me and that you're in this similar situation and I'm gonna take another drink so because that's the only thing and also know I'm not really that I'm not overweight to such a extent I'm pretty fiend-like don't get the feeling like oh you just need to lose some weight no I don't trust me I definitely don't really need to lose weight anyway it's all I had to say yep bye	Character count: 16451 | Duration in seconds: 1429 | Characters per second: 11.5
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSk8NDiITgo	distress	I don't feel like myself anymore..	hey guys so I haven't really exactly sat down here and made a video in a pretty long time it's been probably like 2 months since I've sat down I made a video and today I just want to have a chat because first of all I miss you guys I've missed making videos and um yeah I just want to tell you guys you know what's been happening and the reason for why I haven't been filming so basically these last couple months I just really haven't been feeling 100% myself you could say I just wanted to make this video because you know there may be someone else out there who is feeling the same way as me and even if this doesn't help you which hopefully it does but if this doesn't help anyone at least if you know you're not always feeling a hundred percent then you're definitely not alone in that so first off I just want to say nothing like really bad has happened anything like that I am totally fine and I'm definitely starting to feel a lot better these last couple of weeks I'm actually feeling pretty good right now and I've just been feeling you could say stuck and just like very stagnant it just feels like I'm going nowhere and all these things that I'm trying to do in my life and all this if it I'm trying to put in with my career and just live life in relationships and things in general it just feels stuck and like nothing is working so I guess I've just been feeling a little down I know it will go through this but you know usually I have lots of video ideas and I'm really excited about filming but more recently I've just been really struggling to find that level of motivation but only with YouTube but just with life itself I guess and sometimes you just feel like you're in an environment that isn't pushing you and you just feel a bit unmotivated and uninspired and it affects your mood and it affects you I think that living just being alive being a human being on this planet is all about sharing our experiences and connecting and talking to one another so that we can help each other grow and I feel like it would be selfish of me to keep this to myself if that makes sense it's really great that so many more youtubers are talking about these kind of things now and are talking about mental health and all of that because it is so important I'm not trying to make you feel bad for me I'm not trying to get attention from this like this isn't anything particularly bad I'm not like super depressed or anything it's just I just feel like I'm stuck and just a bit down and I know everyone goes through that so just want to kind of share where I'm at and see if they can help anyone else out as well since I haven't been feeling like myself I promised myself that I wouldn't make another video until I felt a hundred percent like me again like happy Danny even though how I've been feeling isn't something super serious to be concerned about or anything I still didn't feel right coming back on this channel and just making like the usual travel or comedy or whatever those types of videos that I usually do I just felt like if I was gonna come in here sit down with all my video and turn this camera on I honestly I couldn't just be like hey guys how's it going my name is Danny and welcome back you know because that's how generally baby because I'm usually quite a bubbly can an outgoing person and I get really excited about talking to you guys but it didn't feel genuine because I haven't been feeling in that mood so I thought that you know next week and it's gonna be fine I'm gonna be feeling awesome again so week rolls around I still feel stuck in the slump and I'm like I'm not filming like this another week and now it's been a couple of months that have rolled around and I am feeling better now but I didn't just like randomly wake up one day and be super excited and super happy and like yeah let's go let's film a video I was kind of waiting and waiting to feel that way but then I just thought what's the point in that because it's almost like I'm just putting on this persona and that's character and I'd only come on to this channel when I'm just going to be this super bubbly like person that just doesn't have you know any kind of negative emotions or feeling and um I've been kind of getting sick of just not filming anything so I thought hey this is me this is real and we can't always be that bubbly persona that a lot of people do and I put on on their videos because into the day we're just real people talking to a camera I don't say that most youtubers aren't a hundred percent how they are in their videos in real life all the time for sure but I've always just wanted to be as Braille as possible on this channel that I can be otherwise I just kind of don't see the point in doing it if it's not going to be genuine I feel like just shoving all of that under the rug and you know just pretending it's okay and coming on here and trying to be that person wasn't the right thing to do I don't want my channel to ever just be a show or a version of myself I want this channel to be Danny and although Danny is happy Danny most of the time Danny is also just a regular person just like you are and all I've ever wanted to do on this channel was to talk to you guys and make friends and just like sit down and have a chat my friend I haven't talked to in a while ketchup so if I was to keep making videos as normal I just kind of feel like I wasn't entirely being honest with that so I really just wanted to say that it's totally okay you know not to be okay 100% of the time so if you guys have been feeling in a slump or just not quite yourself feeling a little down I just wanted to make this video to also share a few of the things that I've been doing that have really helped myself lately every time we're feeling you know lost so every time we're feeling down every time when we're feeling sad I feel like for most of the time we go out and we try to figure out what it is that's making us feel that way and look for why it might be a look for those things that we think will make us happy and fill that void or fill emptiness that we have you know it could be anything like for me sometimes it's feeling like I need to have that amazing job right now because you know I'm not good enough I'm worthless I'm not where I should be in life I feel like you know sometimes I feel like I'm behind other people why aren't I like this person why aren't I aware she is maybe it's thinking things will be easier and I have more money when I have this outfit that I want what I've got more stuff and I've got more clothes I'll look better and I'll be happier but what I've realized is each time that I go out and search for these things that I think will fill that void inside of me when I come back home every night all I'm left with is myself and I've just realized how disconnected I feel that I am with myself there's just no relationship there if anything I'm so hard on myself all the time I feel like I'm never good enough I just put so much pressure on myself to be this perfect person and it's just not achievable or at least in the materialistic realm in that way striving for that it's not always a bad thing but you get lost in yourself while trying to match society's expectations of where you should be each time I go out and I search for these things don't end up feeling any better about myself in the long term and I need to realize that even once I do reach those goals and get those things that I want it doesn't automatically just mean that I'm gonna be super perfect and happy and everything's gonna be brilliant in my life once I've got there so no matter how far I come with my career and all the things I own if I have a nice apartment I'm still left with myself and if I don't have that really positive relationship within myself there's always going to be something missing so I've just realized okay these things aren't the answer this isn't the answer to try to make yourself feel complete getting better grades than someone else a better job a better apartment isn't going to make you feel fulfilled and that's something I am trying to learn and accept within myself so I can work on what I ultimately need to to be happy which is having that self-love we often just lose ourselves and these things and let our thoughts and desires take over anytime I've been out there looking for answers it just comes back to me hey me again I'm just left with this so what is missing at this point I'm thinking of the thing I've been searching for and what I'm looking for is me and as stupid as it sounds it is missing that relationship with myself because at the end of the day I am the only person that has control of my mind that has control of my thoughts and my emotions and my ultimate sense of self worth and self happiness that comes from me not from any of these things that I want in the materialistic world I am the one who has control over my happiness and my inner peace and I think when you have the realization of how much control you really personally have over your own happiness and just how much power you have over it it's not really something that you can just be like okay cool I love myself like awesome and then it just it's like rainbows and Sun shines over night because it takes a lot of work you've gotta put the work into yourself but hey like you deserve it and I deserve it too because you know we are these amazing beings with so much potential and we're headed of beautiful things so we have to really tap and when it comes to aligning myself of who I want to be and where I want to go in life I'm realizing that to become this person the in goal shouldn't be when I've got this apartment that I want when I live overseas and my dream location when I have may dream career when all of those things might happen that's not the answer of who and where I want to be in life although I feel like my mind gets caught up with thinking that it is but it's really something that I can be doing right now and I can constantly be bittering myself and be becoming the amazing person that I am and are growing into every day rather than just when I've achieved a specific goal it's something that I think I have to really try to tap into myself and tap into that potential that I know that I do have without letting my insecurities guide the way so I wanted to tell you guys about some of those things that I've started doing help me find that sense of self love and motivation and positivity so first things first this sounds like a big one but you can actually take little easy steps I'm trying to take more control over my thoughts and my emotions and I'm doing this by distracting myself this is great for anyone who gets lost and their kids like I definitely do what you think is what you become and I feel like right now or recently anyway I've been having you know so many negative thoughts and feelings and I've been so harsh on myself and so negative and so I mean almost bullying myself it's just torture but what you think you become so I don't want to become this I don't want to become all of this negativity as it's just going to keep tearing me down when you tell yourself that you're sad or you're worthless or whatever it is whatever it may be this is just going to solidify that feeling and if you keep telling yourself it enough you're just going to believe it and you're going to accept it and that's gonna feel like a part of your day-to-day life and who you are when it's not and this is a really destructive way of being but we entirely have control over this which is the really exciting thing about it these negative thoughts we almost turn into reality but really they're just in our head we shouldn't let it become us because it's not who we are we are so full of love and light and potential and we are all equally amazing beings and if no one has told you that today then I'm telling you that today so instead of doing that let's repeat those positive thoughts those positive things that we know inside ourselves that they are the things that are true the most about us one of the things I've been trying to say to myself that I think it's time to help is that I am a magnet that's right ladies and gents I'm a magnet I know it sounds it sounds stupid but think about it if you're a magnet and you're gonna be really negative you're gonna talk bad about yourself you're gonna talk bad about others the only thing that's gonna come into your life is that negativity but of course someone who tries to show gratitude every day and it's thankful for what they have and is positive and constantly tries to look on the brighter side of things you are going to be and turn drawing in all that beautiful warmth and all that amazing energy into your life I am a magnet I have a magnet so just repeat it anything like that's close to you or anything that you relate with on a positive level tell yourself that and reinforce it and repeat it because like I said what you think you truly become so let that guide your thoughts instead of these other feelings that aren't true I am a magnet when I put that positive kind energy and positive thoughts out into the world that's what I'm gonna get back it's all about manifesting that thought if you repeat that a hundred times with intention you are going to become that positive magnet you will be positivity and that is what is going to make your life more positive everything is interconnected and if you can tune in to that energy that's gonna help a lot the other thing that really helps clear my head and just put things into perspective really is being in nature and getting outside and just enjoying how beautiful this world is and just being one with that and feeling the flow of life and movement of other living beings I'm gonna sound crazy but it's something that's so powerful going outside for me it's going to the beach breathing in that fresh ocean air experiencing nature being up a mountain being in the bushes being in the forest just having a connection to something bigger than yourself that gives off all this positive energy naturally anyway that can be something really powerful I feel like when I'm surrounded by nature and this beauty you can get this really beautiful feeling that you feel like you're connected to the world that you're in this is just something about surrounding yourself with nature and the energy that radiates from every living plant every animal and every person just makes me realize that we're all one and we're all United and we're all together and the realization of that unity just feels so humbling and so peaceful and I feel like it's such a big step towards happiness the energy from nature and this life force just fills you up put so much inspiration and it's just like a breath of fresh air for your soul and your mind and the last thing I want to talk about that sounds so easy but we actually forget to do it but lately I've been catching myself out when I've been feeling kinda stressed work home or anywhere and we started doing this and just focusing on it and it actually really helps so what it is is breathing when we get stressed out we get really stuck inside of our own heads and we can't think about anything other than you know what we're specifically stressed out about when we're just focusing all of the energy into this one thing that's not gonna help us next time you find yourself feeling really overwhelmed just break the cycle of what you typically do or change the environment and that next moment we're not starting to feel down if I'm not feeling good I might just lay in bed and literally just spend hours aimlessly scrolling scrolling through my phone not even really thinking or caring about anything so if I either go somewhere else and change the environment or if I just come back to breathing and focus the energy on that and slowing myself down this can help you solve the problem of you know losing yourself in your own thoughts so easy just to get stuck into these patterns and these feelings of sadness or you know worry whatever it may be so break the cycle and take some deep breaths focus on your breath or focus on I guess you could say chanting or what we were talking about earlier which is that positive reinforcement and what you think you become so just keep focusing on the positive things that you want yourself to think about and you want yourself to be and then this is who you become so every time I start having these feelings lately I've been trying to do this and I feel like it's really been helping me so personally I've never really been much of a journalist at all I never really write things down but lately what I've been trying to do is just reflect on my day a little bit and try to channel any of that positive energy and you know good things that have actually happened into my thoughts so I can focus on those instead of letting those bad things I'm not so happy thoughts come in and this is so easy to do if you're lazy like me and just don't have a lot of time but still want something like this to do I've just been writing down in my notebook when I'm grateful for from that day and I feel like gratitude King so so far and it really does play such a big part in our happiness so I write down today I'm grateful for and then whatever it was that I was grateful for no matter how small it may be the best part of today was fill that out as well and I also answer I was happy that and kind of channel whatever the most positive or the happiest thing was that happened in that day and you know actually reflect on and remember that and then lastly I'll say what I'm looking forward to for tomorrow because no matter how shitty you think your work week or your school week or whatever it is they could do is going there is always gonna be something positive tomorrow that you can look forward to even if it's something as simple as a dog which is probably my main key to happiness or to be honest then you know you're just gonna be a much better healthier happier person because of it so anyway guys that's pretty much all I have to say so if you didn't know make it this far I just want to say thanks for listening to me thanks for putting up with me and I will be back very soon with my regular kind of videos so I hope you guys have had a good day and if you haven't just tell yourself those positive thoughts and you know what you think will be so bye guys	Character count: 18425 | Duration in seconds: 1309 | Characters per second: 14.1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jVdGuC-qPM	distress	Very emotional/real chit-chat grwm: IM NOT OKAY, losing people, depression, fear (PART 1)	hey guys it's nitro welcome back to my channel this chit check get ready with me um it is my birthday today but I still make this because I still have a very sore throat I am in am i've pain and everything the word I throw hurts my little heart hurts I'm so motional if we're being honest or even at the ball start with YouTube channel I know that YouTube was something I wanted to do for years but I was just always really caught up in you know what I thought people would think about it and obviously now I'm over that and I really do wish I would have started earlier just because I see so much growth in so much potential in my channel and what I can do and for me high school was really really bad honestly um high school just was not or it was it wasn't all bad but it just was overall was not a fun experience for me ignore my hair please I'm going to do it after I do a makeup I just pulled it out of my face well high school is not a very fun experience for me so I didn't want to give people another eye I didn't care that people disliked me but I didn't want to give people another reason to have something to say about me which is why I pretty much waited till I graduated to start high school and that's really terrible if I could give anyone advice on something like that I would say do not because I see someone's growth so much go through my channel already that if I would have started you know when I wanted to imagine imagine how far I could be right now so I just wish I would have done that Oh today is my birthday and I am in a terrible mood and it's not to be because I know some people would think that see that it's like it's your birthday like some people don't even live to the 18 year I'm grateful blah blah blah I don't want to hear any that because it has nothing to do with how grateful I am to see 18 years it's you know things can still happen to you know upset you it doesn't mean that because you're just being grateful doesn't mean you get to you know excuse or disregard of your feelings so I just want to get that out the way right there I am just it is just birthday for me I celebrated my birthday with my family um the weekend that just passed and that was awesome I'm not at all saying you know my birthday celebration was bad that was really fun and really awesome and I'm really grateful that my parents did all that for me it was really fun but today I'm just not okay I had a plan to film today a birthday you know get ready with me and you know I'm just gonna be all happy and you know whatever because it's part where they work the one thing I want my child to be is real I never want to make content that is produce content that is not authentic to who I am as a person that's just not what I want to do so trying to film a video today there was anything but this would not it just wasn't sitting right with me I've just been in such a a weird um frame of mind lately and not that I haven't been myself but I've just had I'm a very emotional person if you don't if you don't believe in astrology then you're gonna roll your eyes at this but I am a cancer we are very emotional always and so you know I'm always emotional which is recently I've just been you know a bucket of emotions I lost someone recently and it was a very weird loss for me something I'm not necessarily you know hundred percent comfortable you know going into details but it was just a very weird relation to that person and the loss just not only hurt because I lost someone but it just brought back a lot of a lot of feelings um a lot of really scary feelings that I haven't dealt with in a really long time you know they come from a place where I was not happy I'm not depressed now I used to be very bad but I'm not there at all now I'm very happy with myself and I'm very happy with my life but just to be back to like those thoughts and that frame of mind to be reminded of all that was just a very it's very emotionally draining um I'm so I've been dealing with that and I've just graduated high school and um obviously that's stressful I've decided I'm going to college a semester late I'm not taking a gap year but I need to go uh semester late because I went to school I live if you are in Maryland then you know what this means if you don't live in Maryland or you're not in the DMV area you're gonna have no idea what I'm talking about you know but I live in PG County and my score was going to was in Anne Arundel County because I got started there and it was just really important for me to finish high school where I started it so I could graduate in the class of people that I know just because I'm a scaredy cat I really didn't want to go to a completely new school and meet new people and my boyfriend is my best friend I didn't want to not be finishing high school in the class with him I was just afraid to be away from him and my best friend Anaya and it was just terrifying for me so I just um just I didn't do my makeup cuz now I'm just talking I'm not even doing makeup it's a 40 minute drive 40 45 minutes um so I had to wake up super early and every morning bless her soul she's so supportive of me I really do love my older sister um she drove me to school every day 45 minutes out from where we moved and I you know I always appreciate that for that and because of that I never I did that my 11th right year and my senior year and so because of that I never really got to do driving school I never they got through druggie school so I now have two and I am moving out I'm jumping I'm jumping around I never got to do driving school and that wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that I'm moving out so my mom my older sister and my stepdad all Drive and they are very helpful with getting me to where I want to be and where I need to be so that I'm grateful for but they're not gonna be there to do that for me anymore because I am moving out um so I'm starting school a semester late because I have to do do driving school and I just want to get that all the way out the way not only driving school but because I'm moving I just need to save more you can never save you can never save enough I just need to work work work work and trying to get a job literally since I had a job that's how it worked was March these March of this year and it is June now it's the end of June now and honestly at first I wasn't trying very hard like I was like you know I'll fight here and there but I've been trying to adamantly get a job honestly since about the end of May and it's now end of June and the issue with that was because I was not 18 places weren't going to put me on full-time and if you needed to be you know 18 to do a full-time or all the rid all the good jobs you know the jobs that were gonna pay me well enough to sustain a life you know on my own were hiring at 18 so I really just had to wait until I was old enough to apply to 18 and older jobs so like two weeks for my birthday and started applying and so yeah so I just need to just save I need I just need time and I know it worries the heck out of my mom she thinks I'm like not gonna go to college but I want to be a dance teacher dance is what I'm most passionate about and it's what I it's the career path that I want to go obviously you know obviously it does not make the most sense and this is not to discourage anyone or say that it doesn't make sense with other people do it but it does not make the most sense to you know be working part-time job and going to school or it doesn't make sense to be working like a part-time job and going oh I'm not gonna go to college I'm gonna do dance auditions until you know Alvin Ailey picks me up or something that doesn't make sense and the chances of that are just they're just too low for me um it has nothing to do with my ability you know I believe in what I can do and I know that I'm great at what I do but I don't want to put myself and I'm one in a million chance shot at life that's just not smart to me so that's not what I'm going to do yeah so I don't want I know that my mother is extremely worried and she's like the longer you put off college the higher the chances you're just gonna not go and she does not mean to be discouraging but sometimes it comes off like that and even still I know what I want to do and when I when I want to do something when I set my heart to something because like I said I'm a very emotional person so when I get attached to the idea of something I make it happen the last job that I had I I was absolutely in love it's not a big company it was Agassi um oh god I can do a story time I work in there don't even get me started oh honey um it was a gauzy and I was so set on getting that job it was a two stage interview and I had loved the store and I had you know called them and acts that they were hiring a thousand times and I was getting nose and they finally started hiring and you know I was just really set on it that's just with everything when I set my heart to something I it's going to happen for me so I just wish that you know I could get my mother to understand that if I set my heart to this you know this is what I want to do this is what I'm going to do and she knows that because like with moving she goes um she at first she's been supportive of the idea because she's just very supportive of be so she's been supportive of the idea since day one but she's like you know I think you should wait consider going to college on campus I'm like that's not what I want to do and at first she thought it was just me you know saying I wanted to do something and then she saw a series I was about it you know that is just you know 100% what I want to do I want to move I want to be independent and we are in the generation of you know it's no longer super weird and super shocking that someone is 18 and you know they want to move out and want to go to school on campus that is becoming more and more common in this generation and I love that because we often get pegged as being lazy you know labor lazy we're not motivated you know the Millennials don't have their stuff together they don't want to buy homes you don't want to do this you don't want to do that so I love that um it's becoming more common in our generation to you know move out at earlier ages I think it's great I think I would rather be independent soon and learn and make mistakes and screw up early in life so that what I'm ready to really you know get my stuff together I can do it with ease when I'm ready to bring children into this world I remember I can you know do it and not have to worry about putting them in jeopardy of anything obviously everyone's gonna have their own opinions on that but that's just how I feel about it so I've just been sure I stopped buying things like that um I need to hurry up so I can start saving because the sooner I get a job sooner I start saving see my concern you know driving school the car isn't the issue for read the driving school is the issue so the sooner I could start driving school because I am not living close to my parent like I said I live in PG County and I went to school at Howard County I'm moving in the area that I went to school that is the area that I lived in I've only been living in PG County like I said the last two years um and that is the area that just feels like home to me that is the area that me and my mom and my dad before he passed you know we moved to Maryland in that area and so that's just where I want to live that just feels like home to me that is just you know where I feel the happiest and I want to be a walk to drive not have to be in anyone elses time not need anybody else's help you know so just trying to get my life together and that is a job in itself my birthday got off to a very very very very bad start very early	Character count: 11804 | Duration in seconds: 901 | Characters per second: 13.1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWh8S7Y1d6Y	distress	a battle I feel I can never win, very emotional and real vlog	hey guys so I just had like massive panic attack so sometimes when I have panic attacks it's not like I can it's not like I'm short of breath or you know like like I said sometimes my attacks can come with me being very agitated and like today I've been really agitated but I didn't know exactly what my problem was and so you know I was sitting here watching them in like we were talking and like I could feel myself becoming more and more agitated for like no fucking reason no it's not my time of the month he's like maybe no no I haven't had one of these in probably a good two years I had one of these it's my band ever bypass and so let me explain to you what I go through when I don't work on what's really bothering me when I don't actively like talk about it if I don't what go to therapy which I haven't been able to get it there because he's still in Fairfield and you know with Thanksgiving he was gone two weeks and we haven't been able to run over time my mother-in-law is only available on Fridays so I got a heating blanket so anyway let me let me tell you so I don't have somebody to like really I don't want to say fix but when I don't have somebody who's got like answers like my therapist does like you know he kind of sits down he's like okay what's going on with you and how can we fix it and he's not like oh I'm sorry you feel that way or he's not an echo box like he sits down with me and like a crowd or ice cream or I yell around I just tell him I'm kind of verbal diarrhea and him and I haven't had that in a hot such a minute and even though I talk to people it's it's not the same you know what I'm saying like I have really amazing friends that take really good care of me and like my mother-in-law takes it that's something else honey to talk about real quick like some of you think that my mother-in-law doesn't do anything like she's not helping me and she's not being really awesome like she does so much for me she in my eyes she's a fucking angel like I could not have asked for a better mother-in-law and like I will tell you all about it you know like she takes many things I need to go to we go grocery shopping together we watch movies together like her and I have a special kind of bond you know she understands my depression because she's also bipolar you know dude do we clash sometimes everybody does I don't think there's anybody who lives together does not you know that doesn't have some kind of head button so but she's an absolute fucking lifesaver you know Matthew would have been gone and you know if she was still living with her daughter like I'd have to live by myself and that's not a terrible thing and I could you know I could image to live by myself if forced to it's not it's not a necessity that I have to live with somebody to be okay but I know me and being alone 24 hours a day like it's not healthy for me and everybody is different so you know people who are like well you need to learn to stand on your own and you need to be able to do this I've been there honey and I have done that I've had my own damn place I paid my own damn bills I had my own damn job like I've made many over the years so I don't even want to hear that shitting in the world I don't want to hear it like that's that's the end of that shit but I don't want to hear that no more like I have been there I have done that I have left an abusive horrible horrible relationship a terrible fucking relationship for me like you have no idea what I went through with this relationship and managed to go to school get my associates degree pay my own bills and everything else so don't tell me that I don't know what it's like to be on my own like you have no idea I have literally been on my own since I left North Carolina and I lived in Tennessee for half my life so that should take will not have probably 13 years so and then I was with this other person for a couple of years and it did not work out in any way shape or form it was very bad bad for me that relationship was terrible for me we also had somebody else living in the house who treated me like shit I mean like literal terrible who mocked me and made fun of me all the time and would talk shit about me to the person you know I was involved with and like you know just making me feel like trash and I was making many on so you know it wasn't that I wasn't pulling my weight or making many it was just the simple fact that this relationship was bad for me and the people who were in my life at that time when I was my most vulnerable were horrid to me so Matthew and his mother this is the kindest and best relationships I have ever had in my entire life in my entire life so I don't want you Pete you guys to think that she doesn't do she cooks all the time she picks up groceries she helps me with the dogs that she takes me out to places that I need to go like doctor appointment she's going to be there right after surgery for me she does a ton of shit for me she probably does more for me than I do her so that's a complete misconception and if that's what you get from my vlogs I feel bad because that's not the truth she is fucking awesome she takes amazing care of me anyway so sometimes my panic attacks can manifest when I don't want to deal with it like I'm a pushing myself too hard I mean walking too much me I I am one extreme or the other either I do absolutely nothing and I'm completely depressed or I am manic and I'm ready to rule the fucking world and I don't want to stop and then when I have those ups it's called hot by mania when I have those ups I don't deal with anything and I started having that when Matthew left and I went and visited my friends because I didn't want to be a sad sack the entire time and I didn't want to be miserable the entire time when Matthew would call me so you know I forced myself to be up for him and for me I didn't want to be depressed so when I came home I crashed of course but it didn't last long enough and I didn't really deal with any of the issues that I'm having and yeah I'm like super fuckin emotional tonight like just I've had food is a drug it is it is a fucking drug I would rather eat to make myself feel better than to use opioids I would rather be eating a chocolate gummy bears cake cookie anything ice cream whatever I would rather eat that then to take my pain medicine because I'm thinking because that honestly makes my brain feel better it hits all those pleasure spots it is like fucking heroin and you can't get away from it like you know people are like oh but you know you can choose this you can choose that that is like having somebody carry around a fifth of vodka that is open or a martini all day long in their fucking alcoholic and that's their favorite thing in the world sugar addiction is one of the hardest things in the world to get rid of and I don't know how people fucking do it and if if there was a way that you know I could figure it out and I would do it on my own believe me and I feel like a constant failure I feel like if I have a piece of candy or if I have a handful of gummy bears or if I have you know a piece of cake at a party or something like that or if I have this event that I'm failing myself and that that takes a toll on me because after I've had those things those feelings and everything that I'm trying to eat down mentally and emotionally I'm in a lot fucking pain and I don't like to come on here and be like yes I did this and that I'm hurt that it's awful its worst thing ever and when I wake up like I can barely move and when I'm trying to get down the stairs like I sit down and try to scoot down I'm like I don't want to tell people that because even though you guys know that I had issues with my back at my hip there is that part of me where I'm like some people have it so much worse so what the fuck am i crying about what is my deal what is my issue you know some people like are in wheelchairs some people have MS some people have you know Lou Gehrig's disease some people have shit that's not curable they don't need just a hip replacement they don't need just to lose weight these people have honest-to-god horrible diseases and here I sit like why are you big fucking fucking baby and I am trying really hard not to think about the war it's stills my breath from my lands I'm trying not to look at the news and try not to talk to people about it I'm trying not to you know ask too many fucking questions because I'll lose my shit have it my husband in danger and there's nothing I can do about it and there's no way I can get to him at the moment so when I see him on skype I don't talk about working he doesn't talk about that stuff with me because he doesn't want to scare me hard but people haven't worse so when I don't deal with shit like this when I do the one extreme or the other what I don't actually work hard whatever is bothering me I have different kind of hitting attacks where I start shaking and my hands go numb and my lips turn blue and my fingernails turn blue and I can't feel my toes and I'm just shivering as hard as I could possible until my neck and my head is like busted it really the only thing that makes it better is for me to go take a hot shower and then know that I have to deal with this I have to deal with it I have to I don't feel like an inspiration I don't I don't feel like you know that I've come all that fucking far because I still do this because I can't control myself so you know I get weight on the 14th and I have done everything I possibly can to stay away from everything I have had cheese today I've had just meat I've had you know a shake excuse me vegetables excuse me I've had more water than I care to tell you and I need to talk to somebody about it and I hate to unload it on somebody I hate like this and I never want to unload this on my husband that is not fair I thought it to me that's not okay right now because he has so much he has to deal with the last thing he needs is me to add on to it it's not like when he was here and you know I could tell him all the things that were wrong and he could just hold me and it would make things okay and we could talk about it it was completely different I cannot do that I will not do that January will be two months two months which means that he only has 12 more to go after that so yeah I'm having panic attacks it yeah I'm scared about my surgery because my husband won't be there and yeah I'm still going through with it and yeah I still believe this is the right choice for me but it's still hard it's it's still hard for me to deal with it's still rough on me to just try to keep my shit together and day after day after day after day after day and push and push and push and push and push until finally like my body's like no more no more Nirvana no more and today was that day like I've hurt all day long I'm at headache all day long and then I've been agitated and then it's just like that like I started shaking violently and like everything turned blue and I was feeling a little sick and I went to obviously a hot shower and I feel better but none of this is easy life is not easy for anybody I don't know anybody who's got all their shit together and I feel bad for every military wife that has to go through anything like this you don't know what it's like until you've had to live it you can't you can't understand what it's like until you have to go through it and then you have to figure out what the hell evening Dave I appreciate you guys talking to me and talking me off the ledge so to speak I was hoping to avoid all of this but it was avoided anymore Matthew's doing okay it was very cold there again my mother-in-law is amazing to me she does more for me than you guys can even imagine you know you she doesn't want to be on camera when she's not made up like she's just like Matthew that they don't really want to be on camera that much so instead of her been you know like me who's got a camera in my face that's not what she likes to do so you guys only get little snippets and little pieces here and there like me opening up her ice cream she wasn't offering it to me I didn't I don't even like that kind of ice cream so I mean that wasn't a big deal for me you know what I'm saying that she buys plenty of vegetables and you know she makes stir fries and she tries to do their very best she can and I can't tell you how much I appreciate her being in my life and being my friend and being my mother-in-law and birthing the most beautiful human being that God has ever created which is my beautiful gift Matthew I pushed myself yesterday and that's okay I don't mind pushing myself but when I crash I crash and today my body was like you must deal with this now before you end up in the ER with a stroke or god knows what like you you need to deal with this now because I have gotten rid of all the sugar so I cannot eat myself better I cannot make myself feel better in any way shape or form unless I can talk about it I mean you guys were like my best friends I let my family to me they said move you've been here a long fucking time and I'm really appreciated you guys have seen the good the bad and ugly with me and you don't know what that means to me so I'm gonna end the vlog here it's been 20 damn minutes and meet crime and rambling everybody's having a wonderful Monday I hope I didn't make anybody upset or cry I just I love you and that's my

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljXLDoKu4CM	distress	Silent emotional pain	so silent emotional pain I have a fun video for you um you know how lots of people on YouTube they try to make videos fun well I guess I'm like the downer channel cuz yeah I feel like I'm always in silent emotional pain which is what i'm going to talk about um keeping it real I didn't want to make of it or I thought about not making video about this but I'm like it like this is what my channel is about is like just trying to be real and I may not have very many solutions but I can share my experience and maybe if you feel the same way you don't feel so alone so basically I feel like my life is just and I know lots of people say this but it's just like work come home eat sleep I feel there's so many quotes like like living a life of quiet desperation the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results but like I can't help it I guess it's just like change is so freaking hard um but yeah basically I feel like I have no one to talk to my therapist helps i did recently meet somebody and that's been kind of cool I can talk a little bit with her but still it's hard I feel like I'm just suffering in my pain every day and it's like I don't know part of me is it's just like fighting or resisting things avoiding things so I live with my parents and I can't talk to my parents because if I say I'm unhappy or miserable those be like well obvi should have listened to us and became an accountant or you need to go to a job fair everything with them is based around like money earning a living living I just can't talk to them about emotions at all like like I said before when I was depressed in college I told my dad he said When I was your age I didn't have time to be depressed and like you know talking about how he worked 18 hours like you know he slept like two hours at night cuz he had two jobs in college and um I'm not just so weird that like that generation they were in survival mode and it's like then you have mmm our generation who was supposed to be like benefiting from the fruits of all their hard work but if you don't have any like emotional support or foundation it's like so impossible to like grow and just live and be an adult I listened to a mental illness happy hour podcast which I'm plugging again I made video about it but he's big on group therapies and are going to group therapy and i do want to experience what he's talking about but like one I like a group therapy and it was like ninety dollars a week I don't know maybe I just haven't found the right the right group but ninety dollars a week like I thought group therapy was supposed to be cheaper than individual therapy because I actually have a discounted rate the therapist I see now so i only pay forty nine dollars a session which i think is pretty good so I thought group therapy should be less than that but apparently not and also part of me is like embarrassed like like I don't know I have this thing where I feel like I'm spoiled and and I'm behind other people my age who are like married or on their second marriage they have kids I mean technically people my age could have kids that are like getting ready to graduate high school actually I didn't I didn't meet somebody two years younger than me and she has a son that's like you know just sort of high school so it's just crazy like and you feel like you're behind and so me I like isolate and then it's like I fall even farther behind so it's like really rough yeah but anyways luckily I have because I have social anxiety I feel like this these videos are my way of getting my my emotional state and pain out into the world and hopefully realizing that I'm I'm not that bad yeah so so that's my deal i guess and i'll talk to you later I yes	Character count: 3750 | Duration in seconds: 448 | Characters per second: 8.4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGe4uWEvwe8	distress	Divorce | Why.	hey guys um this video is very impromptu I was not planning on making a video Thomas or really anytime soon but it's been something that I've been thinking about for quite some time um Lily was cupcake cover tops just sent me a link to a video that she made for me and I'm absolutely beside myself to move it you know other people are touched by my story in a way I mean ah I'm beside myself and it's given me the push and kind of the inspiration to share my story and to tell you guys exactly what happened and the reason I want to do this is and and the reason I've been contemplating doing this for so long even though I said I'd never do it is because I feel like it would help more people and then it could possibly like you know hinder me in the future or the boys Deacon knows about it now not to this extent but he understands why his dad's out of the picture so I feel like you know in the future obviously he know more and maybe probably even more than what you know I'm gonna share but I want to share my story with you guys and explain to you guys why why I'm divorced and maybe I mean I'm sure some people have already kind of figured it out and put pieces together and you know able to understand why but yeah I want to share it because I feel like it might it might help it might empower somebody it might make a difference in their life like it has mine granted you know my life is is harder than it's ever been but at the same time I know that I did the right thing and I did the right thing for not only myself but for my boys and for the safety of my kids everything you name it like I just I know that it was the right it was the right decision so um okay so about the men it was like the middle of Drake's pregnancy I noticed some weird weird behavior from my ex and weird in this sense that like you know he'd get home and he'd go use the bathroom for an hour just like be in the bathroom for an hour just you know odd behavior but nothing that I thought too much of but he was like a little off he's a little jittery he was a little off I think there's a video it's probably off but if you guys remember I tried to play a spaghetti prank on him and I recorded it and there were I had bought these noodles from like world market that were like two or three feet long and I just thought it'd be funny to like be trying to eat a spaghetti noodle and like have it be three feet long so I did that and in that video a really good friend of mine actually had watched it and her and her husband had commented to me me and he's really jittery he's really weird is everything okay and I you know even then didn't think that much of it and as as time had gone on I started to know like we're really financially struggling and at that time I had a great job he had a great job we shouldn't have been but his checks were you know a little bit less and less and less and I was trying to do more and more to like pick up the slack and I again I didn't think anything of it because I thought that you know he was just putting his checks in the bank well this one on and shortly after that time it kind of evolved into a really hot temper and to where everything made him snap and just flip out and yell and scream I actually remember having a birthday I was pregnant I was with deacon in the bathtub and I was just hysterically crying because he had just completely flipped out on us about nothing so I have a horrible memory horrible memory but I do remember a few things and that was that was one of them specifically I just remember trying to like hide my face in the shower curtain so that Deacon didn't see me so upset and stuff like that carried on for a long time so the the the verbal abuse of it it started getting really ugly and it wasn't something that you know I was necessarily comfortable with but I blamed things like stress I blamed things like you know work stuff like that and I found excuses for everything more and more he didn't want to hang around the family he was working six or seven days a week 13 hour days we just weren't seeing him and when we did he was ugly and again money kept getting tighter and tighter this just kept getting worse and worse it was like a snowball effect fast-forward up a little bit to Drake's - Drake's birth yeah and at the birth I remember my birth video graphics that a videographer say that when she was editing the video she couldn't find any she had like no clips with him in it cuz he wasn't like it wasn't really there and while he was there he was short and snippy and like yelling at people and just an asshole to put it nice like just a complete jerk and he wasn't he wasn't really there so and in the pictures in hindsight you can see that he he was not there and that's when things I mean really that's when things started to get bad we moved to be closer to his work and to save some money because at that time I had I put my job to become a stay-at-home mom because financially it just kind of it it almost made more sense it was it was kind of a it was a fine you know it was a fine line but it did that things started getting suspicious he started hiding his phone things were very very strange for a while and again with the abuse and things like that oh ah so this is when I said not long ago if I have any regrets I'd be I would I wouldn't just make up excuses for things I would actually look into them and understand like okay or give them you know a credit my gut instinct okay all of a sudden this this person that I've been with for at that time like nine years is all of a sudden being so mean to me and so short-tempered and just so horrible at one point I remember he got mad at deacon he was in the bath he wasn't he was giving Deacon a bath and he got mad at deacon and I was doing the dishes or something and I looked down the hallway and Deacon sitting in the hallway sob soaking wet naked just screaming and I'm like what is going on he's like he splashed like are you kidding me um a lot of that kind of stuff a lot and that was like every single day okay so because this is very spur the moment and I have a horrible memory my mom and my sister and my grandma all do too so it's it's like a hereditary bad memory thing um so anyways that that had been going on for quite some time things like that short-tempered just really weird really weird behavior we hit a point it was when we started doing p90x or shortly around that time that his weight just fell off of him and I attributed he named me X to that because I'd lost a lot of weight too and you know it was it made sense and I mean it still make sense but in hindsight there's things about it that are a little more clear than they were I must say that I'm a little naive and I'm pretty as some people put it pretty square they're pretty you know I'm an open-minded person but I'm pretty like you know I'm not a good sorry the windows the windows open it's like a fan effect and just lame door effect I'm pretty you know I'm not I don't smoke I don't really drink I'll have a glass of red wine every once in a while sometimes if I go out with the girls I'll have like a blended drink or a whiskey ginger you know something like that but like I'm really like I've never done drugs I'm very like you know so I don't I don't see a lot of things and I don't see a lot of things that may you know be right underneath my nose you know in this case that was that was it in January of 2013 actually if I if I can go back for just a second I had called them out on the money he basically worked a completely commissioned job and you would get a drop and it was like kind of like a salary in a way and then anything above and beyond it'd be his like commission check if that you know that makes sense well all of a sudden is DRA started becoming less and less and money became a very very hot topic I remember I was returning things to Costco unopened items just so I could buy like produce and fruits and vegetables and things like that so I've heard quite some time it was really I mean it was really bad and he blamed lending people money is what he said he was doing so he was lending people money and then he'd get paid and he would miraculously deposit that money back into our account it's like an extra 20 bucks oh they gave me an extra $20 for letting them borrow it and it was fishy but you know I believed him you want to believe him at this at this point we'd been married for 10 10 years we got divorced at the 11 year mark so I left three months shy of us being together for 11 years and married for five um so I want to believe him I wanted to believe him and I did believe him for so long and I stood by him and I did everything I could well okay so I have to go back even further because I forgot about two big events that happened before then well before we had moved no this is after after we'd moved I set him down so this is before that January that I just mentioned ignore January we'll get there um so all this money was missing yeah and I had some speculations like I thought maybe he was like you know doing like bats or something I don't I don't even know lottery I I would really did not know so I sat down with him and I talked about it and he told me that he had a pill problem and it it surprised me because he'd always talked about people at work having problems with them and how it's just destroyed their lives and how they have no money for anything and that's all that they do well it had gotten out of control he had been withholding large sums of money from his paychecks and in addition to that getting money from like payday loan places so he had some ridiculous debt and if you guys remember some of those Facebook Facebook sales I did where I was selling like clothes and and things like that it was to pay off those those payday loans so that we didn't have that debt because it was just it was such a burden that happened and it took about three months to get out of that and I thought things were good that's when we started doing p90x it was kind of back a whole time like I said it's a blur and it's not a ton of my life that I like to remember but you know well this ended up happening again and this was the January January 2013 I was in the master bathroom and his wallet was on the counter and it fell or I had a hutch I don't remember exactly what happened but as wallet was open and I saw a registration in it Michael why is our registration in there and they took it out and opened it up and there was some course dolly things in the bottom of it okay she was posted on Instagram that girl I'm just beside myself with her right now I'm gonna cry again the Lighting's good I look like crap but the Sun is like perfect right now so it's like washing away so much um but I found this substance in his wallet and at this point I mean things have gotten so ugly so ugly and at this point I had I had text his dad and I said I need to talk to you I need help this is this is beyond me like I can't even express how much has been going on before this point but I had suspected some stuff again after I bailed him out and he said if I ever text his dad or anybody I know that he would leave me and I was terrified I didn't want to be left I didn't know how I could do it it was so scary to me and that I'm just divorced as such it's just something that I could have never in a million years fathom fathomed oh I text his dad and I eventually I'd like to sit down with him and I said what is this I and still I took a picture of it I'm so glad I did I took a picture of it and then I flushed it for about nine million reasons was I upset the main one was the fact it was accessible to the kids and that he'd been lying to me and I just I couldn't believe it I didn't know what it was later I'd found out that it was math and it it was ugly and again I had to bail him out of all of it and I did and I stood by his side and my dad had my dad hadn't okay my dad hadn't known at the time but his dad had offered you know to help her to come down and try to like straighten him out things like that his family knew he was different everybody knew he was different because he was I ran out of space but he was the ultimate jerk such a jerk we struggled for six months and there were some behaviors that I now I now understand that I didn't before and I took a class in college and shame on me for not paying attention to it but it was one of those like if I don't know if all colleges run this way but sometimes you just need to get like a random like one credit humane and I don't even know what they are but I did one because it was an online class and it was only two weeks long on drugs and it just would happen if I did want to basque culture to it so happen to like fit my schedule and that's why I did it I didn't really learn anything from it but I studied it took the tests and just purged all the information um shame on me because I could have used it but he developed a hobby I don't know if I ever mentioned this in my videos or now but with remote-control helicopters where every single night he would get home and he would diligently work on these things and everybody else just got snapped it the kids were snapped at for talking to him while he was doing it or being a part of it or anything like that like it was just it was horrible at a few times like he actually liked like let's go fly the helicopter like it would work once every few weeks and they would go out front and do it and that's something they did together and I I cherished that time cuz he was actually spending with the kids but he'd wake up in the morning he would be doing that he'd be sitting on the toilet he'd be working on that he would come home from lunch and he was working on that he would take it to work he wasn't doing anything but like focusing on these and remote-control helicopters the reason my table so destroyed outside the fact that I've kind of just totally let it go especially with all these kids but he had glue on the table and paint on the table and he had all this like horrible horrible smelling glue that he was using all the time and I was constantly like please can you take them outside that's not good for me to breathe it's not good for especially the kids to breathe or you would just it needs to not be in the house and spray painting the house and just completely careless and reckless and he just developed this like insane like hobby and come to find out meth users I do this a lot with cars and they just tinker and tinker with things and play with things and just put us together and take it apart and put it together to get apart I didn't know that this was a sign of anything because he had told me that he had stopped and that he was only using it in his coffee in the morning or his protein shakes in the morning when we were doing p90x so his birthday our deacons birthday came so we're kind of into May and I maybe one day I'll get into details about how horrific those six months were but they were horrific um the kids Deacon was showing signs of kind of distress from it all and from his dad being such a jerk I was told when I went to set up for deacon the birthday party then he was yelling and screaming at the kids and he was still at the house with another family member and this is who I heard it from and that Deacon was just repetitive lambing the door against the wall the front door and my ex was just yelling at him for doing it and Deacon was just like and it was just that weakened his family who had been visiting told me that it was time for me to go and that I needed to leave and that the yelling it was constant yelling and screaming and just abused towards me and to the words the kids it was just it was done it was enough I had put in my time I dealt with it for two years well two and a half to two and a half years of the abuse from him and the ups and the downs the highs the lows the back-and-forth I mean just the chaos of it all yeah so it was quite some time and I then called my parents and I said hey I need to talk to you guys and instantly I lost it because I was talking my mom just this to me I know what she's not here I don't know if there's other people like that but I'll be so strong and everything's okay and I can keep it together and the moment I talked to my mom or I gave her a hug I just break I do this all the time with her um but instantly and that's when I went and I stayed at my parents house and that's when you guys started noticing like I wasn't wearing my ring I tried for so long to try to my dad offered what is it Oh rehab my dad offered care of it for him so many things so many things we tried I can you just just you know it just sucks it sucks so bad to know somebody for such a large portion of your life then have them choose a substance over their family I don't even know what to compare it to what people say though is there a chance that she'd ever get back together in the beginning yeah I wanted to my dad actually said he's like write down on a piece of paper what your idea would be and my idea was for him to get sober and to be the person I married and the person that I had children with but it's been almost a year and a half since I left and it's only worse so this is why when he sees the kids at supervise he doesn't have custody over them probably why he doesn't have a job and the worst part about it is is that he's not in the wrong everything's fine and that you know um he says he won't hurt the kids for when he sees the kids all it is is picture time so he can post pictures on Facebook and that's it and they're just not a priority in his life I'm clearly not a priority um it's a shame and now I mean I can talk for another 10 hours about this topic but I just I guess I'll open it up to questions now you guys know um I'd be happy to answer questions the reason I'm doing this video not to bad-mouth my ex I've been diligent about not making him look like person that he is and keeping these things under wraps because I haven't even told everybody that I know personally but I feel like it might help somebody somebody who might be you know living with somebody who's dealing with these same things to know that it's okay to leave I mean you have to get to a point where you make a decision that's best for your family and he by the way I didn't know that he was still using when I did leave tests later confirmed that he was because he was very insistent that he wasn't even now even today there'll still be times where I'm like oh you know he's acting normal he's gained some weight back you know um and I think that maybe things are are better and that he's better and he's on the right track but he's not and it's only recently the way he talks to me still and the things that he says to me and the things that he does that has made me realize it's not gonna change it's not gonna change anytime soon I hope that one day it does I'm not holding my breath so anyways um feel free to email me if you're going through something like this I'm still going through it um there's a clause in our divorce decree or not I don't even know if a clause is the right word there's a part in our decree that says that he could not have them unsupervised on his days until he passes three consecutive drug tests he's taking me to court to dissolve this which shows me that maybe somewhere down there he does want the kids and he doesn't want to spend time with them because he's he's although I haven't you know he goes days and days days without even calling them but there's a part of me that thinks maybe deep down in there somewhere but clearly he's not in the right spot to change and to change his habits and I don't know what will make it change but again I'm not doing this video to you know just count him or his character or anything but my hair is too slippery anything but um you know I just hope it helps so again no pity I'm hopefully getting through this and I'm on the up swing of things it's been bad and it's only affecting me harder and harder and worse and worse and everything else every day but you know there's there's a light at the end of the tunnel and hopefully hopefully we reach that light soon so as far I'm sure there's gonna be questions on what I tell the kids and how they're taking it and things like that and they do know now they know all of it and I think it's important so I'll be more than happy to share what I told them whatever leave questions below I'm going to totally be an open candid book about this now because I think it might be more common than I know and that is is even said so anyways um thank you guys so much for your support through all of this even though you didn't know exactly what happened it's helped me more than you can ever I don't know what I would have done without this community and well a lot of it's really hard because there's a lot of ugly that comes from YouTube and some of the people who follow there's a lot more good than there is bad so um I'll stop talking I'll talk to you guys later	Character count: 21064 | Duration in seconds: 1583 | Characters per second: 13.3

video super long so um I just wanted to come on here and before I do anything um once you listen to my story or once you listen to what I have to say I would love to hear your stories in the comments it's always good to know that you're not alone it's actually one of the best feelings so that you're not alone depression is the absolute depression and anxiety are the worst fucking things that anyone can ever do with I guess um I guess everything that I've gone through when I was younger um I guess that's triggered I think how do I say this okay so some of you guys may know the things that I've gone through a couple videos have been um deleted because of family meet because of family reasons but if you've been around for a while you would know that I've gone through a lot of shit in life and I was very sad today you can't really explain how you get sad or why you get sad so I just I think I think and I think and then um I was looking at a face on my Facebook and then I was looking through my pictures and I was listening to music cuz listening to music really soothes the soul for me music is like it's like heaven for me when I'm sad I love listening to music and I was looking at all of my pictures and I was like you thinking my head was I happy this day was I happy then and every single picture I remember exactly what I was going through I remember everything even though my pictures may have been super fucking smiley maybe I've been smiling forever I was broken I was so broken and I'm sneaking when was the time that I was truly like a hundred percent happy with myself and maybe I was four maybe I was five I think once I think once uh my parents separated once they got me married uh I've been stopped I've been sad because you know um and I can't really talk about this shit which pisses me off um I guess but I had gone through when I was younger has made ha has affected my life as an adult um I think the way I was explaining today one was some people that have been molested when they were younger when they grow up they either do drugs they turn to prostitution they get obsessed with having sex um they love older men um and I guess the only reason the only way to explain myself is my anxiety and depression I was so fucked up in the head and I went through so much shit when I was younger that now it affects my life my day-to-day life every single day um I feel like there's not a day that goes by where I'm not sad there's not a day that goodbye when I'm not crying there's not a day that goes by when I would represent happy and yes I know that you know update Lynne she makes me happy and I think that people that goes to what I go through you know you can't truly explain this you can't express the way you feel um I think that I feel like if I was given anything in the world it wouldn't make me happy and I feel so terrible that that Dave Len has to deal with me it makes me sad it's affected you know not affected our relationship but I feel like every time I talk to her I'm sad and I have to say the same thing over and over again and she doesn't quite understand but she understands to an extent and I've noticed I'm sorry that I'm crying I'm sorry that I can't control myself but this is a vintage Ellie this is me expressing my my feelings um I feel like I feel like I'm making Dadeland sad I've never seen her so sad lately she says it's because a body issue her body issues she says they're getting to her but I feel like me I feel like I can't talk no I don't know how to say it I feel like I have made her depressed I've put her I've I don't know I don't know I honestly have no idea daelin is such a happy person you guys know you see it in the videos she's always been a happy person and maybe the past week or two things just have been sad it our relationship is not rocky that's best for sure consist raagas has ever been I'm just saying that I feel like my depression wears is wearing off on her and I feel bad and I feel sad because I would never want someone to feel the way I feel never and when I see her cry and when I see her sad it breaks my heart even more it breaks my fucking heart ah okay I'm going to stop I just wanted to post avenging with jelly this is how I'm going today this is what I wanted to film it's okay not to be okay but it's not as simple as that I feel like every day's every day is a new day for sure every day is a new day but I feel like sometimes I just can't look forward to the next day I try so hard to look forward to the next day and I guess something so tiny something so small will just remind me of something that I went through my my childhood and I try so hard not to focus on it so Hulk I don't know I've no idea I don't know where to went to what I what else I want to say these videos on scripted um I like that's why my videos are so long because I like being so wrong and uh one thing um I want to date one to do an updates video with me today and we were talking and I was like we should talked about you know moving getting married um us being sad um things that had been bothering us and she said I don't I don't want to talk about I don't want to do update dates video because I don't feel comfortable talking about those things right now enough that broke my heart she's never done that ever she's always been like okay yeah let's do it let's film you know we're going through something sad well we'll talk about if weird if we went through something terrible we'll talk about it whatever I guess it really is tricking triggering her and sometimes I just want to take that pain away and just put it on to me because I am the one that bit that is been living with this for ever so I don't know what else does it I just wanted to I know of service so many times that I just wanted to come out here talk to you about it and I know probably said the same thing over and over and over and over and over again and I'm sorry I'm not looking into the camera I'm looking away because sometimes I just feel really weird looking into a camera and sometimes when I look away my my thoughts can process better and I don't know but how much know if there's something that you do or you something that you tell yourself or something that if someone's helped you through your depression and anxiety what was it who was it has it fixed you um I know that this true that this doesn't go away it won't go away it's going to stick with me forever but if there is one thing that I could do to better myself or to put me in a better state of mind I would love your advice I know usually it's the other way around me trying to give you guys advice but I would really love to hear your side of the story and if there is anything that you've done or that helps you throughout your days I would love to see those in the comments I read every single one of your comments and I like to know that there are other people out there like me and I know that you guys want to know that there's other people in this world like you so I'm sorry that this video was super long but I love you and let me know if you want to continue doing these munching with jellies don't get mad at me fight if I don't do them very often um I kind of just want to get on the camera and record when something is happening I think it's better that way something reminds me of something that happened I will talk about it then I can put my absolute heart into it and have you struck through this video and you don't like me crying anything that says benching with jelly in the description don't watch them because this is me I'm broken and you don't really need to listen to someone that's sad that's my best advice don't listen to someone that's odd when you're a happy person so I'll see you next time you guys and thank you for watching this video I hope it helps you in some way or you get to know me a little bit better so yeah I love you guys and I'll see you next time	Character count: 8451 |

problem I don't give a damn what kind of group hello my name is Jody and I am depressed today and that's okay what else you know I have to be kind to myself these days come my therapist told me that it was healthy to wake up and not check if you're depressed aisa wake up and I'm like how am I feeling today am I here the answer is always no I'm still spaced out still don't really feel like I'm awake and then I go oh no and now I'm depressed as well after you recommended not checking I felt better because I was like oh yeah I'm just going to continue with my day who says if you check then you usually find so I stopped clock in problem is today I don't have to joke sometimes you just wake up and your brain is so heavy you can't help but notice that so my topic today now is idea and depressed I know so well when I'm depressed I can just tell exactly when my brain isn't working properly it's very chemical it feels very physical there are days when I feel sad and I know it's emotional and it's because of a situation or something that's getting me down it's like a weight inside my body whereas when it's like a chemical depression this feels black my brain feels rotting nothing works like I don't get anything your chest is heavy the whole day I just feel this constant longing for something and I'm not getting it suddenly nothing is easy everything seems terrifying and difficult and complex and messy and heavy like nothing's going to be okay ever again and that this is the normal this is where my head goes to naturally and that every time I show how you're feeling better you're going to feel better again bits of life and I'm lying to myself and this is how I should just naturally feel and I should just stop treading water and let go and give up and just fall down to this dark pit where I am now Wow I should put disclaimer at the start or something this isn't a very positive video I guess but I interesting to catch it in the moment just might like working head am I not working head are so different and they don't have empathy for each other asshole when I'm feeling healthy I'm like how on earth could I ever not feel like this there's so much to be happy about Anna sermon to be hopeful for why not just choose happiness and choose the hopeful route I can't put myself in my happy minds at the moment but that's I think what I feel I remember just being like oh I always know I'll come up afterwards there's always enough after a down and I will feel good again and that's what I write down in all my Diaries and on my wall don't worry you'll feel okay again this is just temporary for us right now if I was to write a message to my happy self I don't want to do that obviously I'm not going to bring you down happy me if I want to it would be like love stop killing yourself I'm not going to do that because I know objectively I'm sure this is just my brain up no-one's natural state should be this bad it's so bad so bad oh this is when you know you're depressed you just get nothing from anything I'll watch a TV show and I'll be like I wonder what else there is to do I'll go outside now just feel hopeless and like well this is I want to be outside when it's nice and feel nothing I'll go back in and back why don't I just spend a whole day in bed considering I'm not gonna get anything from anything else when I was depressed in the summer my mum had booked this trip to like a water slide in I don't know it's like a Groupon whatever I'm blessed to try I love her so much she was like this will cheer you up and I'm like mom when you're depressed you don't really get cheered up by things so we're a functioning happy version of me we'll go down a waterslide and go we depress me it's just going to feel a bit cold and uncomfortable so just kind of put the body in a slippery wet thing below in terms of where I'm at I'm still dreaming still feel very much like I'm not here the realizations depersonalization like a car as my eyes widen are when I look like far away from me everything just looks like painted on it just don't feel real and that's what's so frustrating and that's what gets me down that's what makes me depressed it's like I know that I'm not getting the full picture of life I feel blind I feel like someone's taken something away from me and it's so annoying that I used to feel so excited for feeling everything and everything being so vivid and so much fun and it just feels like someone sucked out the fun of every I have to experience and I'm so scared that I'll never feel that again and that's why I get so hung up on the past all divided because I felt it then will I ever feel that again and it feels like I never will so I just want to go back to where I can feel again I'm sorry I'm depressed I'm usually a little bit kinder to myself and I'm like there's no point in just wallowing and I find the funny treat yourself do something nice but when I'm this bad it's like taking a bath is just going to make me feel hot and bored going to bed is just going to make me lie in the dark I feel bored eating edamame beans this is actually quite nice so that's why I did that yeah I don't know it's just annoying when you're sitting under jock stuff is being my pain yeah so I felt like drunk for the past four years of my life and they're like alright let's get you a blood test I guess so I have my rose so let's see if it's my thyroid who knows I'm trying to get referred to this depersonalization clinic in London which is where I live that would be great but because it's only NHS you have to wait for funding and the specialist and all that jazz and it's just waiting waiting waiting and every single freaking day I'm waiting I'm just like what a waste of my life oh the last time I went to the doctor we were kind of sitting there like well what do we want to do while we wait and she was like have you thought about medication I might look into it gave me a leaflet where is it yeah see SSRI antidepressants alright so that basically gives you Motor Trend Report is great I think that's what I mean five to seven and some people with moderate or severe depression it means halved improvement instances well dry dodo I'm open to the idea still being good for my life I don't know what to do alright this is me on an off day hi welcome hello it's nice to meet you I'm very sorry at least I'm at home the worst thing is when this kicks in in like a social situation and I'm just like glazed eyes I give people nothing I'm like I can't I have nothing to give you I'm sorry if I ever meet you in particular in person and I'm feeling a bit off I apologize in advance it's nothing you've done I'm not mad at you I'm mad at myself right I'm gonna finish my beans wash my face and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ic-eEk_tTM	distress	i woke up depressed today	okay so today balls today I woke up satin today I woke up depressed which was weird it was like it's weird how some days you just wake up and you feel it and you're like today today is not my day huh yeah wasn't my day it's actually not been my day the past two days which is weird because there's a lot of good things happening in my life but I have a really hard time seeing the positive which is also weird because I talked about seeing the positive a lot I'm not trying to be hypocritical I just have trouble too so I asked why are we sitting down I wanna chat we're just gonna which is kind of just gonna chill and I mean I'm boiling right now and I decided to hit the hot chocolate which is boiling I don't know why I keep sipping it so I saw my friend I don't know if might know it's not my friend she's more of like an acquaintance I would love to be her friend but I don't know if she's my friend Dodie I did a panel with her at playlist we've met a few times we're nice people we say hi she made a video called I am depressed today and I thought it was amazing I thought it was so so real and I've been finding myself watching these type of videos a lot recently because I've been waking up in this mood and super weird it's helped it's helped me a lot it tell me a lot knowing that other people are going to it to really helps me and I think that's what you guys watch this channel and I think that that's the main reason why I wanted to make a video I just wanted to sit down and talk cuz I haven't a really hard time thinking about like what to film not that it matters anyways I don't really have a schedule anymore I have this problem where if I'm successful I always find a way to bring myself down because I don't think I should have that high of expectations in my life like a really really good thing happened to me last week a massive thing out of this world I can't what it is I'm not trying to be that you two are saying that this students happening but it can't tell you because they don't even know what's happening yet but like this huge thing happened and I can't seem to like it anymore I can't seem to enjoy the idea of it and it stresses me up and I think negatively it's a problem I know another thing that's kind of positive is that I've been working out a lot recently and if you follow me on Instagram not saying actually you should probably go follow me on Instagram it's at Joey guinea it looks like this it's really cool I love talking you guys on there and I've been working out a lot recently just because I wanted to get my body into a shape where you know I like it that's that's literally the only reason why I'm doing it and I find them very hard on myself at the same time like I'm like oh I don't have like the packs of this guy and I think like a lot a lot there's a lot of stigma in men's health we always look at that cover or we look at that Instagram picture whatever we're like wow we want to be that guy I want to be that big you know or small whatever you want in life and it's really been stressing me out lately but like it's a good thing I don't know when to stop another thing that have been kind of going about lately and I haven't really told the main channel this I got into school again which is really cool yeah I got into like a really cool program it's kind of like my dream program right now for school and I don't know if I want to go not because I don't like to school I mean I've already graduated from college if you don't already know but it's just like I don't know if I want to look back is that taking a step back I know education like my problem is I'm not from this my problem I know everything I know the the reason why we feel things and everything like that and why I'm feeling the way I do and there's like pros and cons to everything I and I get both sides of like why I shouldn't go and why I should go but I'm like I have a really hard time figuring what the middle is I'm not asking for you to help me but like I don't know if you relate to this a comment down below yeah so I'm really straight I'm stressing about school everyone's like go go go and I'm like what is it for what if I'm putting a hole to my career what if I'm taking a step backwards what if I get this this crazy opportunity and I'm stuck in school and then the other side of me is thinking like well it's just school you can leave it and do it again if this opportunity is that amazing you just cool and so I'm like okay I'll go to school but then the other side comes back with another point in this side comes I go and it's just this oh I don't even want to go I'll figure it out I haven't cleaned lately I'm a big clean person i spilt hot chocolate the powder and I still haven't cleaned it I'm looking at it and it's bugging me but I probably won't do it until tomorrow actually I'll probably do it tonight but I hate I don't clean anymore because three people three people came over to my place and they're like well you clean and I felt really insecure and I'm not trying to be a hypocrite III tweeted today and I was like I hate people who preach things that they don't do and like I preach about being yourself but I I don't know why but if these demons are attacking me being like oh are you clean stop cleaning and I'm like whoa I just like to look at my TV without seeing fingerprints like who the hell is touching my TV cool why are there fingerprints on my TV I don't get that who where did those going brother the demons I don't know I don't know I'm in this like state I don't know and if my mother's watching don't I'm okay but I just I don't I don't I don't know I just wanted to sit down and like in like a fetal position and drink hot chocolate and talk that's it I just came back from spin class I've been spinning lately because my neighbor is a spin instructor and every time I walk in the hallway and I see him I'm like damn cuz I know he's gonna invite me to spin class and it's like it's really fun I think I'm getting okay at it but I start like to not die which is really cool a lot of people are bugging me right now about relationships and everything like that and I'm just like can we chill can we just like take it down here it's like it's it's it's right now there's a lot of everything happening and it's all good stuff it's all good stuff and that's the hard part I don't know how to handle good thing I'm very great amazing at handling bad things I'm so I'm so good at handling depressing horrible moments wait is this one of them am I not good at this anymore damage I think the last thing I wanna talk about is I've been seeing like this therapist recently and I've seen therapists before like I've seen them in the past um and they they've they've helped me I think I think they've helped me and it's just like talking to a stranger and just saying everything and almost crying and when you leave that room that person has nothing to do with you for some reason it's comforting except I find it really expensive and it's really hard to go out and find a therapist that's right for you and I recently found like this this is not a brand deal right now this is not a brand deal everyone be okay it's not brandy but I found this website um and I'm gonna I will I will tell you guys more about it after I have a few more sessions I want to make sure this is something I want to tell you guys um but I've been using this website and it's it's really cool it's it's cool it's comforting it's nice it's nice to just be able to get help from anywhere in the world and and that's um that's a whole nother thing is that these society videos been blowing up and it's like it's really cool but I'm also like I'm getting a lot of emails about you guys and I wish I could help every single one of you but I just don't I don't have all the answers and it's just me out and so I'm really I am working so hard into finding someone to help you and defining an organization that is worldwide that is the International and it's just ready to help all of you because I can't answer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f_nkntmNLo	distress	What Depression Feels Like	I was depressed hi you guys so today I'm going to be making a little bit more of a serious video I'm going to talk about my experience with depression now I've been super open about my eating disorder on this channel as well as on my blog as well as just in person because I feel like that's something not a lot of people talk about and I haven't really said much about my experience with depression and not because I'm ashamed of it or anything like that I just I don't know I just haven't really said anything I don't think there's really a reason for it but the other day I saw a tweet from a girl that I knew that essentially just said I can't stand depressed people just be happy it's your choice and I kind of like hit me that so many people are uneducated about depression and then to go along with that I watched the last episode of 13 reasons why yesterday and I can honestly say that it wrecked me and I'm sure everyone else cried you know like everyone was it was a sad episode so I'm sure everyone else cried and was upset about it or something but I was just thinking about like this just really happens people really get to a point where they're so depressed that they want to end their life and so I just thought this could maybe be informative about what it's like to have depression so maybe you don't have depression but you might know someone who does and you don't you have no idea what they're going through and you may be it like makes you uncomfortable to talk to them about it so I just kind of wanted to share this maybe it would help someone so my depression kind of went hand-in-hand with my eating disorder and before I start I do want to say that depression does run in my family so it can be kind of like passed down genetically and so anyways when I was going to treatment I really I really really didn't want to go to treatment I had no interest in going and it was just something I I really really fought and in fighting this it's just all I just felt like everything like tumbling right nothing was going right which kind of caused me to spiral into this depression so my best friend had kind of forced me to tell my parents about my eating disorder which made me really uncomfortable and so upset and then my parents were upset and then I started feeling like I had caused all these issues and it just downward spirals into this depression so this is kind of how it felt for me so to start I just felt like I had let everyone down I felt like I was a problem to everything that was going on like I was the cause of all the issues that were happening in my household with my friends and I just kept thinking like like people's lives would be so much easier without me I wouldn't be here to cause all this chaos in these issues and like my parents wouldn't have to pay for another kid and they would be like better off financially and they wouldn't my mom wouldn't be so stressed out about me and these were the thoughts that just kept going on in my mind and I can't tell you how many times I repeated the phrase I don't want to be here anymore I don't want to do this anymore and I just repeated them all the time in my mom was so worried you guys she was so freaked out as any parent would be if you have a child coming home saying I don't want to do this anymore I don't want to be here anymore I don't want to do this anymore I don't want to be here anymore over and over and over again and just sobbing and that's what it was like I just was like crying all the time and I was I don't want to be here I don't want to do this anymore and of course this was all during the phase of me going to patient like treatment so I just kept repeating I don't want to be here anymore I don't want to do the same work to the point where my mom got so freaked out she slept in my room with me every night because she was afraid I was going to hurt myself every night she slept in there for I don't even remember how long like I want to say a few weeks to like a month or something just every single night because she was so afraid and then so the crying happened a lot at first and then kind of after a while I wasn't crying as much and I just didn't even want to get out of bed I didn't go I didn't go to school for I can't remember so it was like two or three weeks but I did not go to school because I just physically couldn't get myself to get out of bed I don't even know the words for that I just you hear people say they can't get out of bed in the morning but I just like because there's really no way to describe what you're feeling it's like I just I can't I can't do it today and it's not like I was getting bullied or anything at school it's not like school is this terrible place I was just in this mindset of like I can't I don't want to do this anymore I guess to kind of help explain this mindset I used to have a tumblr dedicated to just it was kind of like a diary just online and it was like my name wasn't on it or anything I would just write things so I kind of went through it last night I just found it again I hadn't been on it in awhile and these are a few of the things that I wrote in one post I had wrote and this is the direct quote how could anyone possibly love a girl that has nothing to offer and then another one from a few months later said I don't think I'm meant to be here I don't think I'm worth being here the very first thing I ever posted on this tumblr I think I was trying to write a poem which is kind of weird because they don't write columns and poetry isn't my thing but when I read it back last night I was so shocked I like didn't realize I was this depressed and I didn't think I wrote it not because it's so good but because I just couldn't believe I was that depressed and so I actually typed in the poem the words into Google to see if I could find it I thought I copied and pasted it but turns out I wrote it because I can't find it anywhere the thoughts creep up when I'm oblivious when everything is going good they come out of nowhere as if to remind me of my past to take me as prisoner of my own nine to bring me back to what I used to know a time of shame and disgust these thoughts come every now and then to try and tear me apart every now and then they when they do what they came to do they break me I just I read that I fairly I just people feel that now I was just really surprised that I didn't realize I was bad upset and I was in that state maybe because I'm not there anymore but I just I couldn't believe it and then just to think that that this is happening to people now like people feel this way now and it just gets worse there's some people like I have been able to kind of overcome this and I'll get into that in a second but there's people who don't there's people who feel this way and it just continues to get worse for them everything just seems to spiral out of control and they feel like nothing is worth it anymore probably around this time um self-harmed only like two or three times so not not nearly as much as as you know other people you might see and I did it specifically so people would see these scars I wanted them to see like this cut on my leg and be like what's going on and then that would be my way to help people that I was like so upset I wanted my mom to see it in fact I believe they showed her one time just to just to like show how upset and depressed I was now I wasn't at the point where I was going to commit suicide it crossed my mind a few times but every time someone asked me if I was going to I just said I don't think I could ever go through with it I've thought about it but I don't think I could go through okay while I was in treatment I saw someone else there I don't even know what their title was but I was seeing someone else on the side of this eating disorder program I had seen someone else who diagnosed me with depression and I was put on medication and I had a really hard time with with medication because it made me feel like there was something wrong with me like I knew I was this upset and I knew I was depressed but it made me feel like I was like screwed up like I was born broken and I I just didn't I I didn't want medicine at all and I remember my mom saying if you were diabetic you would take medicine for it right you would you would do something about it and I was like yeah of course she's like it's the same you have a chemical imbalance in your brain and so you're going to take medicine for it and that's kind of I was like that makes sense so that's just kind of what I can piece together and talk about about my experience with depression was just it's hard it's really hard and I just wanted to show people that it it's a real thing I've been through it it happens to people it's real and it causes people to commit suicide in it it's real it's not just people being upset for attention and it's not just people being overdramatic about little situations when you're depressed every little thing feels like a hit to you like just to blow then you don't know how much more you can take again this is just my story of depression I'm much better now in fact when I decided to make this video I went back and looked into things and tried really hard to remember what that felt like which is a little bit hard to go back there but when that's not to say I don't get depressed at all anymore I still get upset randomly and I kind of just just let myself feel it I guess and then I I like try and do something to distract mirror surround myself with people who I know love me but again this is just my story and I'm not claiming that the stories that end all be all of what depression is like but I know there's people who've had it so much worse than me and there's people who may have had it easier and you know like like there's a lot of different cases this is just my personal story and what I can remember about this like really dark place in my life and I just wanted to share it because it's just so real there's so many people who who don't think that is real they just they just think people are doing this for attention and it's it's that's not the case I also want to talk about it because we oftentimes don't talk about it in society talk about depression because it's a little bit taboo to talk about it if it's in pop culture for example 13 reasons why has got people talking about suicide and depression a little bit more which is great but as soon as this kind of dies down so will this conversation so I guess I just kind of wanted to to carry this out and maybe help you be a little bit more comfortable with the people around you who might be depressed and and kind of help help people understand what it's like to go through this and and how you might be able to comfort someone I don't know I just hope this video was able to help someone	Character count: 10827 | Duration in seconds: 722 | Characters per second: 15.0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvkbHIrrrvU	distress	please don't kill yourself // Anna Akana	So, I was thinking . . . I've been pretty open about the fact that my sister committed suicide in 2007. And I've been getting a lot of questions from people on the internet of like, "I want to kill myself. What should I do?" If you commit suicide . . . I don't even know like, I don't even know, what would happen . . . to you. All I really know is what happens to the people around you after you die. I think it'll be really, really hard for your family . . . to live . . . normally for a long time. (exhales) And, um . . . If you commit suicide . . . People will miss you. A lot. (sniffles) Dammit, I don't wanna cry! Cause if I cry, I'm not gonna want to put this up. But it's a message I want to get out there. (sniffles) Um . . . Okay. So I'm sorry in advance if I cry, I hate editing things where you cry, cause you're just watching yourself cry and it's awkward and then you have to actively export that, which takes like 10 minutes. And then you have to upload it to the Internet, which takes a while, so there's a whole process going involved in showing the world that I have cried at this moment that you're watching. If you commit suicide . . . Your brother, your sister, your mother, your friend, your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your child . . . (exhales) All those people . . . who really, really love you . . . will be really FUCKING confused for the rest of their lives. And really angry and . . . really jealous. I'm jealous . . . of everyone who has a sister. (voice cracks) You know? It's been like 6 years since she died. And it's still really hard to talk about. I mean, in uh- just a real way, like cause I can say a sentence here or there in a video. (sniffles) And it . . . feels good to talk about it. Especially when I'm trying to put a message there. (sniffles) But like . . . (shaky breath) (voice cracks) I mean, at the end of the day You know, there's someone . . . who's supposed to be in your life right now. And they're not. And they never will be, again. Probably. No, actually, most definitely. Because we all die. But . . . Augh! It just forces you to ask yourself a lot of questions you're never gonna get the answer to, so it just feels like a lot of fucking unnecessary pain! And like, brooding and agonizing and it feels so shitty, just SO shitty and unfair and then you'll wrestle with these same emotions over and over again every time you think about it. So you try not to think about it, but then if you don't think about it, you can't work your way through it, but working your way through it fucking sucks cause there's just so much of it everywhere! Everywhere you turn, it's there! It influences who you are, it's like a before and an after this event that you did. I am a different person, and I don't know if it's for the better or for the worst, but I fucking hate you and I fucking love you and- (sniffles, exhales) Just don't do it. (sniffles) (laughs) (mockingly) Just don't do it! (catches her breath) So stupid. Death is stupid. I don't like it. (sniffles, exhales) (exhales) But yeah. I think that's . . . (laughs) that's pretty much what . . . will happen after you kill yourself. For . . . a long, long time after that decision. And if you hadn't made that decision, then it's like . . . how many extra years you would have had for things to change, you know? (sniffles) (catches her breath) Stay awesome, Gotham.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2kOQkO0qBk	distress	SUICIDE: What surviving an OVERDOSE feels like	[Music] hello my friends Scott here represents a new potential I know it's been a while since I've done a video for that my apologize please forgive me I've been so busy with work and trying to spend time with my family because I just don't get to do that as much as I'd like but yeah and that's been a while so I've put together this video and it's a I think it's gonna be very very useful it's gonna make people think differently and hopefully for those who are completely unaware I hope it opens your mind and that you learn something from this ok so today's video is all about was it feel like to take an overdose and try and commit suicide reason for doing this video not only because I want people to have a better understanding but at the same time I really really want to make people think about the decisions they're making because I know there's so many people out there that feel a lot committing suicide and so tempted it's taken overdose so I hope this video kind of makes you think twice about it and makes you think differently and make the decision to continue living couple days ago it was world suicide prevention day I should have done this video then but I'm so busy with work I couldn't so I really really really really hope that this video makes a difference to some people ok but anyway before I get on I just want to say that I'm speaking from experience in this video for those who that you guys follow me you know I've taken an overdose although be a while ago I did take a life-threatening overdose and put myself in a hospital it was very very close to not making it the only reason I did made it and make it is because I actually fell out a bedroom overdose and I was just found on the floor otherwise I would have presumed to be sleeping still and then I would have passed away I think that's crack on with it shall we so was it feeling like to take an overdose well from let's cover the physical side of things so from a physical standpoint taking the actual overdose is easy you know you just take the right amount of pills the right kind of pills down up with some water and then go to sleep and then the rest is is a mystery almost you don't know what you you're going into you hope that you don't wake up but if you do wake up you're gonna be in a lot of pain okay when I woke up I I remember first of all was in hospital and a catheter in my genitals you know having a tube in there so could used you know go to the toilet that was pretty unpleasant in itself my my stomach or my kidneys all of that downstairs area was painful it really hurt it was kind of like a clenching feeling like when you've not eaten for a while when you start to feel like you know starting to tighten up kind of feels like that a mixture of that and needing the toilet really badly it's just so much discomfort down there it's it's horrible and obviously having I had a tube in each arm you know cannula so I believe they're called a drip has obviously dripping water into my it's my body to try and flush out everything obviously being hooked up so heart monitor as well now you're just lying there you can't really do anything you can't really move you feel so disorientated it's horrible actually and you can see that the heart monitor in the hospital and it's just beeping beeping and you just you feel so uneasy you feel it's horrible you know just lying in that hospital bed you can't move because you've got neither one each on you know you've got a catheter in in there and then we can do stare and think it's horrible it's really this comforting so yeah from a physical standpoint it hurts it's uncomfortable you just want to move you want to get up but you can't because you feel so weak and so drained and then you start to get with withdrawal from if you're taking it if you take medication that's what you've overdosed on let's get withdrawal cuz I'm not gonna let you take it you've already said too much again that makes you feel nauseous such a horrible feeling you know and you don't feel like eating hungry but you don't feel like eating that's that's unpleasant so from the physical standpoint taken over those horrible from emotional and a mental perspective is even worse I remember waking up seeing my whole family you know my mum dad stepdad I know I'm waking up and the first thing I see is then I start to cry I feel ashamed I also feel disappointed disappointed because I failed and what I said I failed in ending my life and I felt like a failure because I've put myself in a position where they can see that I mean obviously I look back now I'm glad that I woke up you know I'm really glad that I did and I'm here today at the time I didn't want to wake up so I just felt miserable I felt depressed I felt so emotional you know I couldn't hold back the tears just looking at all of them and you know I thinking sorry for what I've done it's obviously they care so much I think you know they they they cared so much about me and they say obviously still do let's put them in that position was horrible and again my own disappointment in myself not carrying it out and I was glad to see my family surrounding me knowing that I was loved but disappoint that I didn't follow through I mean obviously now not disappointed I'm glad that I woke up but just laying there in that hospital bed off the sing after seen the looks on their faces I can't forget you know just sad shocked hoping that I would pull through folks so uneasy emotionally I felt ashamed of myself I felt bad for them I felt like a disappointment for them I felt disappointed myself for not caring yeah following through and ending it you know if you've ever suffered with depression you've only got a tip of the iceberg of what it feels like to wake up from an overdose and you know in the hospital and have your family just looking at you okay there's nothing compared to that to this day that was the most lowest I've ever felt in my entire life is waking up from know those and just thinking fuck I've done you know and then just going on all that time in hospital just laying there and discomfort and I just remember thinking the whole time like I wish this heart monitor it would just flatline I wish that I would just not pull through and just don't know I just I still wanted to carry on what I know it's so I wanted to finish why I started having people come visit you like if friends as well and other members of family you just can't help but feel guilty sometimes a lot of there's a lot of guilt there like you've let everyone down feel like you've let yourself down you know you can't feel positive in that time you know until plenty of time passes and you've had time to heal physically and emotionally you don't you spend the whole time in hospital just wishing that you've done something different wishing that you weren't in that state wishing that you would that you were dead it's so uncomfortable you feel like you're isolated and all alone and even though you've got these people coming around and visiting you whether they're nurses and doctors or your family and friends you do you just feel enclosed in this state of recovery it's so draining you just feel tired you Mind's on overdrive because that's what you can do is think you can't get up and do anything you can't you can barely even feed yourself you'd only feel like eating just it's tiring yeah and that's all I've got to say on the matter really I I think much else can be said but it's uncomfortable you feel disappointed you feel guilty feel ashamed it hurts it takes a while to recover I think I was in there for about two weeks at least so yeah okay you guys I really hope that this has made you think twice about what if what an overdose could do if you potentially wake up it's a lot easier to wake up from an overdose depending on the pills that you take or overdose on but your body is very strong your body wants to survive okay my body for itself out of bed I wouldn't I don't normally roll out of bed I don't normally do anything like that but my body just knew that it was meant to survive so for it so far a bed it's get discovered know it sounds weird and messed up but it did my body just knew something that was something important down the line was gonna happen to me he's you know I've got I've got family I've got two children got a beautiful partner wonderful partner a great job and I'm on the way working on my book done about 24,000 words at a time making this video you know I really aim to make a difference for people but yeah please think twice life is such a precious gift and I know it's hard most of the time but it gets easier as long as you keep keep persevering okay I'm gonna make it please don't overdose if things go wrong it's gonna be so uncomfortable for you and if things go well when you do pass away then the pain that you are suffering you only pass on to the ones that love you	Character count: 8909 | Duration in seconds: 669 | Characters per second: 13.3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLGpw_rOyqY	distress	My Boyfriend Died and it Changed My Life...	I'm already getting emotional hey guys it's Annie and I might get emotional so we're just gonna go with it there's no planning out what to say in this cuz I'm just just gonna go for it as you can see by the title of this video it's not necessarily gonna be the happiest story that you've ever heard but it's a big part of my life and it is something that has really shaped me and guided me to where I am now in life and on the path that I am this is too early to get emotional okay it's something that is sad and it did happen 10 years ago and I have dealt with it and I'm not always sad about it but I think I'm getting emotional right now because it's what guided me to start doing YouTube and I've been on YouTube for 19 years now and I've always wanted to share this but I never felt like it was the right time but I'm learning that there's never gonna be a right time so I'm just gonna do it I still haven't even shared the story yet but the reason that I want to share this is because I hope that it might help other people who have dealt with hard things by the way I wasn't sure if I was going to monetize this video and I'm not sure if YouTube will allow it to be monetized I'll get to the reason why I am deciding to later on it has to do with I want to use the money to help other people and like donate it but I will explain that down in the description as well as further on in the video so please if you're like why is this monetize I have a reason and it's not for myself okay so when I was 18 years old I dated someone and he passed away and it was really really hard on me we were on NC a staff together which is the national cheerleaders Association we put on summer camps for cheerleader I know when you think male cheerleader you might not think like the coolest thing but no he's the kind of person who could just throw up a girl with one hand and just catch her and hold her in the air and do all the crazy flips and it was really impressive and really cool and everybody loved him he was just this huge light so it was my first summer doing nca and we spent that whole summer together pretty much I really cared about him we got really close it is a little weird because being my first year on NCA staff I didn't want him or me personally to tell people we were dating just because like I was one of the new girls it's kind of weird so no one we worked around really knew and you know it's like a co-worker thing I don't know so that was a little a little strange especially when the time came that he was gone but anyway we spent that whole summer together when I was 18 almost 19 and I was really sad when he got the news that he was moving to Texas because he got his dream job at the at the NCA headquarters I was happy for him but I was just really sad because I cared about him and he was moving to Texas but it was gonna be okay because I was gonna save up and visit him and we talked every day we text every day but the only issue was he had epilepsy which I'm pretty sure the word for it is epilepsy because that's the only disorder that I can disorder is it a disorder that involves seizures because I know he when when I was 18 he told me he's like I have this meaning I get seizures and I have to take medication and I'm pretty sure was epilepsy unless you know another thing that has to do with seizures that you need medication for I'm going with epilepsy so yeah I even saw him have a seizure once and it was really weird for me look it was at his house so yeah it was strange but um so he moved to Texas and with his new job he he couldn't get medical insurance for I think at least a month or 3 months or something like that so because he didn't have his medical insurance and he had this move and you know you know that that costs a lot he couldn't at that point afford to get his expensive medication for his seizures so he just wasn't taking it and I'm just I just look back and I think like like I had extra money I could have I know I can't do this to myself but it's like I could have helped him or something I could have given him money and spotted him for his medication but I didn't I didn't know how serious it was so having you know an issue with having seizures and not having his medication and not being on his medication for a month I got a call one night from someone on NC a saying that they found Chris's body it was like the middle of the night it was I don't know it was after midnight like 12:30 1:30 and they said they found his body and I just obviously broke down and it's so weird it's so weird when you have this person that you care about and you talk to them every single day and one day you just can't talk to them anymore I know I don't cry about this anymore I just also don't talk about it and so I woke my parents up and I I was you know I grew up going to church so I told my mom like it was a Saturday night I think it was the 4th of October 4th or 5th of October I don't one of those dates I just cried to my parents and I I told them look I need to go to church tomorrow like I need I need something I need something to feel better I own I don't know it was so hard to come Bria and if you've ever lost someone I just remember being so depressed I just wanted to sleep all the time I would take naps through the day and every single morning I wake up or anytime I'd wake up from a nap I would remember that it's real and I would think like this this can't be real there has to be some way some way just to like reverse time and like stop it there has there has to be some way to make it so this isn't real this can't be real and I remember just I I used to be so excited to get text from him every day and any time anyone would text or call me my stomach would just drop and I'd get so sad because I knew would never beat him again and I would call his voicemail just so I can dial this number and I remember I even texted his phone a few times even after it was gone just because it was so hard to think I'm never going to get another text on my phone with his name popping up or another call with his name popping up and I was just so depressed obviously that's not something everyone everyone dies everyone loses people but not everyone loses someone that they love at such an early age like you know romantically love and I never even told him that I never got to I always felt it I always wanted to tell him that but I never told him that and that's really difficult that I never got to say that to him and I when I get depressed I can't eat like I just had no appetite and so I didn't eat or drink water pretty much like very minimal food or water for a week or two maybe it was a week and I woke up one morning I think my dad was on a business trip so I was sleeping in the room with my mom and I remember waking up one morning I was so dizzy and I walk out to the living room to my mom and she looks at me and she's like what is wrong with you and I was just like I don't know and she said that my face was white my lips were white I was just pale as a ghost she says she said that I looked and I went to go into the bathroom and I just passed out so she took me to the doctor and they had to hook me up to an IV all day long because I was severely severely dehydrated it was really bad and it's not like I was trying to not eat or drink I just like I said when I'm depressed it's really hard and that was the most depressed I've obviously ever been and then came his funeral they had to fly him up from Texas to Washington and as I mentioned with NCA I didn't really want people knowing that we were dating and I was a mess so obviously I was like you know I I said that I told them about it and I feel like the information was not received very well and especially from that point maybe it was just my mindset at the time I just felt not I just felt like the information wasn't received very well by them and I felt like an outsider and I didn't feel accepted but maybe that was just my my you know just going through a traumatic experience and my mind just being all over the place I don't know but it wasn't open casket funeral and so it was just weird I just wanted to be by him even though I know he's not in there I just wanted to be by him I it was so weird touching him and him just being ice-cold and then I just wanted to stay by his side and I don't know it was I I broke I wrote him a note I remember I just remember this I wrote him a note and I tucked it in his suit in the casket I just completely forgot it did that and it was really hard this might sound morbid I don't I don't even know like this might this is really weird to say but he was being cremated after the funeral and just afterwards just thinking like he's no fire right now like he doesn't even exist anymore he's just like dust so freakin weird talking about this I never go into this much detail and I just also don't talk about it very much but it was just really hard and of course I was depressed and mourn for a very very long time but after a few months you know I was still sad but I had to change my mindset I I couldn't be depressed you wouldn't want me to be depressed forever he inspired people and everyone loved him everyone loved him so it made me really realize that you can go at any time life can take you at any time you can be a well loved person you can be going after your dream job and getting it and seeing things can seem great but you can go at any time so that made me realize why not go after what I want to do in life why hold back why be stuck in my hometown why just work for my dad for the rest of my life and not go after the things that I love I've always loved creative things I always wanted to do singing and acting and I just love that sort of a thing so because I always had a desire to do acting never did it because I was always way too afraid to do it I went out and I got an agent in Portland and I started looking up how to do acting and take acting and get into acting on YouTube and through looking up how to do these things on YouTube I found that people had YouTube channels where they their own little sketches and they did their own music covers and I saw that I could do all these things I had interest in acting the singing everything on my own like I could make it myself and I got so interested in that and that's when I made a youtube channel and my whole goal with my youtube channel was I wanted to grow my following I wanted to find the success in doing the things I love to do in order to help other people who have been in my position in order to make money and you know donate money to epilepsy research or you know raise money and help his family out and inspire others to go after what they really want in life because it is short and it also can be taken from you at any point so why waste your time and I always pictured growing my audience on YouTube to reach a ton of people so that I could share this story and tell anyone out there if you've lost someone or have gone through traumatic things and you feel hopeless it can get better and you can change your mindset and you don't have to be stuck in the depression from tragedy and even though it's sad that this happened and it hurts and it's a huge part of my story and why I am where I am today as sad as it is to say it probably was meant to happen because I do think that everything happens for a reason and and I think he changed a lot of people's lives from experiencing him in his life but I think he also changed a lot of people's lives through his death because it definitely changed the course of my life I would not be here if it if it wouldn't have happened and on the bright side as sad as it is the fact that he did move so with his move he you know had going away things and he was able to reconnect and say goodbye and you know connect with people before actually passing away and maybe if he was still in Washington it still would have happened and he wouldn't have gotten that last goodbye everyone the goodbye parties but goodbye you know hugs I love you the meaningful interactions that he had before his move I did find out a little while later if I'm remembering correctly of course it's been 10 years but if I'm remembering correctly he had a seizure because he did not have his medication which led to a heart attack and that is ultimately what took him oh yeah I just remembered I almost forgot this part of the story so I said that I never got to tell him that I loved him well about a week before he moved to Texas he mentioned like oh I hung out with some people my ex was there I actually talked about you tonight and he's like it was really it was really nice and he didn't tell me what their conversation was but after he passed away this ex contacted me online and was like hey I had I felt like I need to tell you this but a little while ago before Chris moved to Texas I was with him and he told me about you and he said that he was falling in love with you I don't know if he ever told you that but I thought you would want to know so that was like a huge blessing no it was like an answer and like closure and I was really grateful for reaching out to me especially when I said how there people didn't receive the information very well like just getting that reassurance and after being like I was never able to tell him I loved him he was still able to tell me that he did back and I know that he's he might be gone but he knows I think he knows that that happened he knows how I felt and he knows that I received the information back so as I was trying to say if you have dealt with something like this I have gone through this I know how you feel I know it doesn't feel real and then I also know that one day it stops hurting all the time one day you just have to move on with your life and it's still always going to be a part of you but use it for good don't be better by it don't don't shut everyone out because you've been hurt connected with people who have dealt with the same thing and you know care for each other and help each other because everyone's hurt everyone's gone through pain everyone eventually loses everyone else cuz we all go at some point this is one thing we can all connect on and I've just tried to use this experience to be the best person I can be it's so weird so weird to actually be making this video now and I know I'm not expressing it exactly the way I wanted to but I wanted to share this story with you because it is why I make videos it has been my goal this whole time to be able to share this with you and just be transparent and I've had other things happen to me since then I've been through toxic relationships and all of this stuff but I'm working to be the best person I can be and to hopefully inspire others to do the same and I don't even have the words for what I really want to say but I hope that this can connect with some of you I was debating monetizing this video because I'm like I feel guilty making money off of this because I you know I that's it just feels weird but then I'm like one of my goals was always to make money to help people I've owned that's always been my goal with success well I want to you know better myself but I also want to help people I'm not saying that this video is gonna blow up and get a ton of views and make a ton of money maybe YouTube won't even let it be monetized but if it does and I do make money off of this I want to either donate the money to epilepsy research or some sort of charity or even possibly donate it to his family because I know he would want to help his mom out if he was still here so that's an another possible option I don't know let me know what you think the best option for that is obviously I'll figure something out and I'll share it with you I just want to help people with with it if I do make money off of this video oh gosh I'm sure there's so much I did not say that I wanted to say any other information that I left out I will leave in the description down below I just want to be understood I want to connect with you if you've been through anything share it in the comments if you'd like to and I encourage everyone else to interact and support each other because we all hurt and we all can help each other and I think that's the important thing in life so with that I hope you understand me a little more now I want to be more open and transparent I've always had a hard time expressing myself and I I feel like recently I've been working on that and I've become a lot better so that is my story I hope maybe it will help some of you please not pity me I don't want to be pitied this this is something that obviously when I go into detail about it it makes me emotional but it it has it has shaped my life and it has given me purpose I'm sad that it happened and it's a tragedy but I'm also grateful that I learned such a big lesson from it um okay but that is all I have for you for this video you know hit the like button have conversations down below whatever you want to do if you want to subscribe to me go ahead and do that I post videos every week it's a variety channel I don't just talk about sad things in my life usually but uh oh gonna recenter myself now and yeah I hope I hope this at least connected with one of you out there and if it

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTrimtDG9VI	distress	LIFE: I Quit My Job... & Why I Couldn't Stay One More Day.	hey guys it's Nikki I know it has been a while but it has been a lot that has happened over the past two weeks I'm sure you see by the title of the video that I have chosen to quit my regular day job and don't mind me if I'm looking down because I want to make sure that I actually you know touch bases on everything I want to talk to so if you're not the kind of person that wants to excuse me watch youtube videos that have a little bit of you know ranting raving or little lengthier responses then move on because this video is just what it is so the week of August 4th I decided that enough was enough the handful of people that know what I was dealing with working where I was working um it had been years of just foolishness ridiculousness and down to the point where you know even in the effort to get HR which we all know you know HR isn't there to help you they're there to help the employer but in effort to get that resolved it never got resolved it was not going to get resolved because when any company you know whether excuse me private sector federal sector when they're out to get you they're out to get you that's just what it is and if I have not you know said it before I smell bullshit a mile away so even before I got to the point where I decided enough is enough I did you know read some things read some articles or its books even got on YouTube and searched for you know people that says you know I quit my job and of course you know what I primarily found was people that you know I quit some bullshit kind of job you know the $8 an hour job something that easily replaceable jobs and I get that and I'm not knocking anybody's hustle but I am in in the IT world and I am in a competitive field and good jobs are hard to come by sometimes but the primary positive that I think I always you know looked at on top of that was given my history if you will the job that I had up until the point of this Queen was secure because in the federal government for the most part unless you're really messing up the likelihood of you losing your job is slim benign they have to literally you I'm sure you guys have been around people that are on federal but it comes a time where you have to ask yourself is this really worth it is this worth you know the energy that I'm pouring into it is this where I want to be and ultimately when I say given my history I don't think I've left a job on the mutual you know oh well you know I'm just going somewhere else and pursue this blah blah blah I don't think I've ever left a corporate America job on that note from the military - my job with CSC after job what after it's all been because people tend to believe that they can treat you any kind of way they can talk to you any kind of way and basically you're going to excuse me you're going to tolerate it for a paycheck and unfortunately and sadly a lot of people will I cannot begin to say how elated I was to quit and yeah I quit in a very epic fashion but it was well deserved given the history of what I was dealing with you know working there and at the end of the day I'm not gonna allow any place to put me in the position that my health is in jeopardy you know when it comes down to it you have to ask yourself is this place worth my health this place where my sanity am I going through all of these things excuse me all of these things for what for the benefits yeah I mean incredible benefits of top-notch but at the end of the day if it's your job that's making you sick or making you more sick what's the point defeating the purpose so either way I left and my being there really made me realize some things and that's what I was about to go into but I will start off with that when I said you know given my history and how for the most part I've left jobs I've come to learn about myself that me and corporate America don't work me and general corporate in it and I can't even say it's corporate America the kind of people that occupy supervisory positions or positions where believe they have this perceived level of authority over you we don't mix because I'm not the kind of person that's gonna allow somebody to just talk to me any kind of way especially someone who cannot do my job you see in my current situation then I just left I had a supervisor that knows shit about IT not even in the textbook context but you want to tell me how to do my job you see I don't have a problem with suggestions but when you don't know what someone's job entails and you don't know how to do their job and you're their supervisor here's some advice for anybody that may be in that position trust that your employee knows what they're doing especially if they've been there a long time allow them to do their job and sure that they keep you up-to-date on what's going on but other than that if you don't know how to do the job leave people alone because at the end there's a what happens when that person leaves you see I was the only IT for the past six years so you replace the body you can't replace the expertise because that's a level of continuity for that place so I'm just over it and at the end of the day that's that's just that me and corporate America don't get along because you have people in their perceived perception of authority that wants to abuse it and think that everybody's going to just tolerate it I'm gonna go ahead and say about 90 percent of people probably will tolerate it I'm not part of that 90 percent I do understand that everybody can't just drop everything but oftentimes that comes from the fear the fear that a lot of people have of leaving somewhere that's negative somewhere that is not conducive to what they would like to achieve their life and I guess in my position it would be perfect for you know somebody who requires that being sucks excuse me stuff somewhere Monday through Friday from 7:30 to 4:00 is not conducive to what I want to do with my life what I want to accomplish beyond what I've already accomplished yeah that's just what it is so after that I did make a promise to myself which was number one I'm gonna use this downtime to see things for what they are I've done a lot of thinking and that includes you know places people things I have some things in the works that I will disclose when the time is appropriate but as of right now I don't see myself just jumping into another job I refuse I am pouring more energy into establishing myself as far as where I want to be with something that I paid 12 a.m. to do which was cosmetology I don't I've never had a problem in that industry I just got my license at a time when the economy was crappy and that in a fear of failure I think that fear of not knowing what's going to come how am I gonna do this how am I gonna do that well I've set myself up in a much better position now to where if that's what I want to do I should be able to do that and I also promised myself that I would not go back to IT unless it was absolutely required and that's just where I'm at with it I can't do it I don't want to be at a job or somewhere I don't want to be for the sake of a paycheck and something I want to be happy doing what I do I want to enjoy what I do I don't want to be told how to do things outside of what is proper and right to do I don't want to be told or or talked to in a manner that people feel they can talk to you that way because they believe you don't have any other skills you don't have any other things to do so departing advice for anybody in a situation whether it be by choice or by force lose the fear lose the fear because I had a brief conversation in which discussing with someone about you know they're talking about how they wanted to go to another company because the pay was a little better and they had a pension and I mean that's not nothing wrong with that but I guess I kind of thought to myself excuse the pause aren't you worth more than a pension or is that as far as your aspirations go you know that's that's not a question for me to answer because I know I don't want to go slave for anyone else day in day out excuse me regardless of what the industry is I don't want to go work for somebody else putting in all this time for it to one possibly not be worth it to have the even higher probability that you won't be there until retirement you have to realize that people are not valued the way they once were in the work industry it's just what it is these companies and businesses they're not loyal to their people or their employees anymore because jobs are so damn scarce these days people will say hey I'm gonna do the same job for you for half the cost and guess what by you know seniority all those things they don't value they don't hold to these things anymore so if I'm gonna slave I'd rather slave for myself because I don't want to turn around even if you stay somewhere 25 30 years you get this pension or this check your retirement but now you can't even really entire you know enjoy it that way because you've spent the last 25 30 years slaving so let me go ahead and slave for myself to attempt to create the kind of life I want so that retirement is not something that I'm really really you know strung out on in making my decisions based on just that I want to live my life to the fullest potential I want to do what I want to do and create a life I love and that's just it thank you all for watching I know this was a little lengthy but this is what it is I had to go I'll talk to you all soon and I'll be checking in with you all pretty soon beyond that as well thanks for watching again bye	Character count: 9566 | Duration in seconds: 790 |

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2js063a1Suk	distress	On Being Ugly	okay so I'm a mess right now and I was actually going to shower even though it's almost three o'clock but the water was all cold so no luck but this being a mess kind of made me want to talk about something that I've really been wanting to talk about for a while anyway so well they're a lot of the time I think of myself as ugly and I don't think that that's a bad thing a lot of the time is just something that I can accept and be cool with and get on and I can just be okay with it just like a lot of overweight people don't want to be told that they're not fat I don't want to be told that I'm not ugly I don't want to call myself unconventionally pretty I am happy a lot of the time to think of myself as ugly I think ugliness only becomes a problem when you let it get in the way of your life end of living I can't say that I've never let that happen but it's something that I'm dealing with and I'm generally okay with when my appearance really gets to me and I'm feeling really gross about it I try to remember a few things one is that I am beautiful in some way because I'm a living thing and I think living things to me at least have some inherent beauty there was an interview with Johnny Depp a long time ago which I saw on YouTube somewhere and I think he was asked something like what is your greatest turn-on and he said breathing you might have just been saying that to be funny or whatever but it's kind of true there's something really sexy and really beautiful about being alive and when you think about being alive and you put that into perspective and you just think about the smallest and biggest thing just breathing prettiness seems to become so insignificant and just tiny tiny so one way I can saw myself is by reminding myself that I am beautiful because I am Alive because I am breathing and that is amazing another way that I can soul myself or deal with it is by putting things again into perspective I think about the universe and I think about human beings as a species and how actually ridiculous we look other mammals and I've got four legs and have some kind of really elegant gait or I mean even cows just seem like kind of magical beings whereas humans are covered in hair but you can't see most of it you just see like stuff that comes out of their heads randomly we've got these facial features that are just like very strange even when looking at beautiful people if you look at them long enough it just starts to look like ridiculous to me at least we don't have this elegance or majestic beauty as a species that Lions have or birds or anything when you put it into this perspective everything just seems absurd it's not absurd to recognize that you're not way that a lot of other people look but it's absurd when you waste too much time on it when you look at the perspective of being part of this kind of silly looking species on this planet in this solar system in this universe that is huge and contains life-forms that we haven't even encountered yet and that are completely foreign to us think about that and then I come back to my face in the mirror and god I wish I just had cheekbones or some kind of facial definition it's it's tiny another thing that goes along with the breathing and the living is that we are living creatures which means that we're not just alive but we're doing things even when we're not consciously trying or aware of things we're breathing and when you actually do things other than that when you get out and you're doing stuff and when you're really engaged and excited in something I feel like the last thing that I care about is how I look I never want to get into this place where I feel like what I look like is more important than what I do and it seems like it's a lot easier to let myself not do anything and to hold back because I don't feel that I have a certain appearance for some reason that that exempts me from having to do things but it makes me any less capable but it doesn't it might make it harder and and it might take work on my part but being beautiful is not an accomplishment and being ugly have to stop you from making accomplishments I talked about the show my mad fat diary the other day but I didn't touch on one of the main basic reasons that I really loved it because I just didn't feel I had enough time and it didn't fit in the video but basically that show is just this grand statement the work of art showing that you can be fat or you can be ugly or you can be whatever it is that you are and you can still live and you can still find happiness and you can still be hopeful and you can make relationships and have friends and have lots of fun and be a good human being and grow and be happy and do the things that you want to do and that means a lot to me I don't think that we get that message enough or when we do get it it's coming from the people who are already seen it's really pretty so it doesn't just doesn't have the same effect on me that show has given me a lot of inspiration there's a quote but from Kristen Stewart at which I'm sure tons of other people have said which is just it's okay to not be okay and I think that's one of the great things of the show is that it lets you know that it's okay to not be okay but also that it's okay to be okay and that you can just be okay you don't have to be beautiful to be okay you don't have to be pretty to be okay you don't have to be skinny to be okay you don't have to have muscles to be okay you don't have to have anything you can just be you and you can be okay with that and you don't have to be okay with that all the time and you can still struggle with it but you can still find some kind of acceptance and love and happiness for yourself and that is HUGE ah the first episode of my mad fat diary is just really fantastic too because it deals with all these insecurities about her body and you think that the character ray is gonna cave into it and she's gonna relapse and just let her insecurities about her body take over but she doesn't and she just has fun and she laughs and she does things and she doesn't let it get in the way of her living and that is what I think we need to review reminded of more and what I try to remember whenever I get dragged down by the mirror or when I notice myself watching myself from within whenever I'm out somewhere I can be things and I can do things and I don't have to let my body or my insecurities about it get in the way of what I really want and sometimes I feel beautiful and I think that's an important thing to recognize too that whether anyone else can see me that way that I can and ultimately feeling beautiful or feeling ugly can feel like the same thing as long as you don't feel like either one of them has to get in the way of what you can do and of who you can be because they shouldn't and they don't and that is something that I am trying to remember always	Character count: 6898 | Duration in seconds: 440 | Characters per second: 15.7

different place than all my other videos normally I give advice on how to be successful how to be happy but this video I'm not doing good at all and in fact I'm really fucked up I'm depressed I feel hopeless I'm lost I'm confused and and I just I feel like there's something inside of me that is just empty like there's this part of me that's empty tell you what guys I think a lot about a lot of things about everything and I think too much it kind of gets in the way of living a normal life you know I can't have fun I can't work I can't socialize I don't have good relationships with friends or family or people you know the main reason why I try to help people out on my channel making videos give you advice is because I'm not satisfied with my life I feel like the life I've gone through so far suck now a lot of people come to me or they tell me that I shouldn't be doing this because I'm only 18 why would I give advice to people because I haven't been through anything my life that pisses me off because you're right I haven't I shouldn't be a motivational speaker because I have never gone through tragedies in my life for example I've never been homeless I've never been addicted to drugs and never almost lost my life I've never been abused then nothing but tell you what I'm doing what I'm doing right now because it's my therapy I have to give advice to people I have to whether it be writing blogs or or making these videos because I'm just trying to understand life and trying to figure out what's real how to live my life and all these answers that maybe I shouldn't think about what I do you know some people can handle their problems by doing drugs having sex some people they work harder than anybody else but that's because they're trying to fill something inside themselves some people express themselves through music through dance through physical things like exercise you know I don't know everybody's problems but I know that my way of dealing things is usually to try to just understand life and try to find something from it try to understand it and then the other way I handle it and I'll be brutally honest with you is I try not to face my problems I try to run away from them and not take responsibility and not face them because it sucks and I feel like a loser when I do so there I just told you one of the darkest things about me so why am I telling you all this the reason why I'm saying this to you is because I'm trying to express to you where I'm coming from trust me I don't want to depress you by this video make you feel worse but there's one thing that I understand from the things that I've learned this so far in life I have learned that everybody has problems that we all struggle through something going on internally whether it be insecurities or something that we just don't understand I don't know and like I said we handle in different ways but I think that sometimes we do things to cover up or try to fill in that space inside of you that emptiness with those activities but they don't actually do it they can't fill you permanently and I tell you what what I'm about to say is not my own thoughts i got this from somebody else in fact if you go study existentialism you'll find a lot of things in that subject talking about meaning and what i heard from somebody recently is that probably the one thing that people want in life more than anything is meaning and maybe meaning is what will fill that in so I want to remind you right now I'm not doing good I really fucked up and depressed because I can't figure out what to do so listen I've been trying to figure out how to take this person inside of me and bring it out cuz I know I can be a smart person a cool person a responsible person somebody who has everything together you know someone who has my own shit together and because you see this a lot and people people just don't have their shit together people are messed up people have problems like I said there are some people who seem to have everything figured out so I'm trying to be one of those people and what I've done so far is I've tried to understand everything you know I study how to be successful how to be relationships how to how to make money how to how to be attractive to people in general and I tell you what I've learned a lot and I understand a lot and I'm gonna share that with you on my channel but there's something deeper I do feel like there's something inside of people where it's almost like a by the flip of a switch you can take all of this stuff that is inside of you and and reveal it all these positive things about you that are being held inside because I'm holding a lot inside myself and all these other insecurities I feel like we can push those away push the bad away bring the good out you know I don't know if that makes sense but you know some people like I said have it together some people don't and maybe from this existentialism idea of meaning maybe that's the answer my goal is to be a loving person and understand everything so love and understanding are two things that I value more than anything in life so why am I telling you this again sorry the reason why I'm telling you this is because I'm trying to figure everything out I'm not doing good and I want to admit to you guys that I'm trying to help you as much as I can through the videos and advice in my channel but this is where it's coming from I question everything I study ideas about things you know I might not have a life that is incredible or amazing or even normal but I tell you what when it comes to understanding these things when I find something that is its golden and valuable you know I have to think of myself as digging for gold here like I go through a lot of BS ideas that are you know like we go through religious things and we go through other things that people are have created themselves and you know none of these things actually fill in that meaningful spot but when you understand everything it all comes together it's all clear so I'm trying to figure those things out and I just soar through a lot of BS ideas out there and answers and I tell you what when I find something that I know to be true I believe it I share it so even though I'm 18 years old I still have to share the things that I know to be true now I might not have the answers to those to tell you how to fix it but I'll tell you what the problem is and you can help yourself fix it um again I'm not trying to say I have the answers but I'm trying to say that I have a viewpoint on things that can definitely help you live a better life it is up to you and my position here is just as a leader to help you understand these things thank you for watching the video um please check out my other videos on my channel again this one was different than the other ones it's coming from more personal part of me and I mean I am very troubled right now very screwed up and lost so I'll see you in my next video	Character count: 7047 | Duration in seconds: 516 | Characters per second: 13.7

video basically telling y'all I'm single I have to release in that video and seeing the feedback I got from me it wasn't a negative it was all positive thing I was before I even started we'll get into this video heavy I just want to say thank you for all the support I'm saying everybody who motivated me to do better and come out on top man I just want to say thank you for all the support thank you for being there for me you know what I'm saying but I feel like I feel like I don't really get no sleep last night I was up and I was thinking in my mind was was just racing I think I think I was at my lowest last night I tried to I tried to like hurry up and just like one of my brain is shut down you know what I'm saying I sat down to like diary anything like that but I doing my brain is leak so I would be overthinking how it was last night just a few things that I'm addressing this video to also imma start addressing her stuff all right first things first why is it that everybody talking about everybody game pregnant before they get married where's my mom married before she got pregnant by your dad was she married or did she just pop that pussy in you had you and then give me where she pain I even married y'all just been talking and that kind of like irritates me a little just a little bit because y'all just be talking on hearing it every time y'all say some shit under my picture for my video y'all think nothing I can't clap back or I can't say shit back y'all wanna play the victim when I say something back y'all wanna order maybe even meaning like that why would you say the shit how would you like if I woulda said shit like that to you you know what I'm saying it's just like it's just it that y'all got her y'all gotta really think before y'all type that shit up you know I'm steady playing victim a lot every couple break up every time the baby born all the couples break up and stuff like them and it's not even about it's not about us having a baby and that's not even an issue debate our baby is not an issue in our relationship I already told y'all in the last video y'all go watch it but I said that I specifically said in my last video that nothing happened in our relationship man chess neither one of us cheated or anything like that man our relationship was actually perfect man yeah we argue but what couple don't argue we go back in Amish what I was saying was like what couple don't argue you know what I'm saying every couple argue everybody argue in a relationship man but it's just like to a certain extent the argument hood it wasn't mixing well with how I was feeling you know what I'm saying which was depressed it wasn't it wasn't mixing wheels and every time I know I'm saying became isolated and wanted to isolate myself and didn't want to be around just or anybody else I felt like I was hurting jazz you know and that's one reason why I made I'm seeing a video because I've just been feeling some type of way this whole time and I know some of y'all comment if some of y'all seen some of your comments on my last video and y'all was basically saying it's our notice that I don't that I really wasn't happy it's not a one happy with the relationship it's not the relationship I was happy with it was me working and pushing myself so much like or not saying like working on that main channel I'll push myself so much like my goal was to hit a million over there and I feel like I'll push myself too I push myself over a cliff you know what I'm saying push myself over the month and it fell off the moment you know I'm saying I kept pushing and pushing and pushing till I couldn't put it any more even jazz notice it rises I think but you really you know I'm saying you really working or whatever like you really but you you are right like she'd just be checking on me and stuff like that I just love to him like yeah I'm alright I wasn't alright you know I feel like I pushed myself too much over there like doing a whole couples thing I feel I wasn't being myself you know and I couldn't really say shit that I wanted to say I couldn't no I'm saying act on anything you know what I'm saying like most y'all don't even know that nonsense I'd be shit I smoke weed and shit we leave that's just that's why I say I need a backwards mostly I don't know going to the owner but yeah but I feel like that really helps me that helped me a little bit you know what I'm saying like when I'm when I'm in my zone like I don't really think a lot I just I'm a happy bubbly person you know what I'm saying and that's one thing I want to say y'all know me as the goofy the goofy motherfucker who who make everybody else laugh deep down I'm hurting on the inside so if you got a friend that's always making you laugh or anybody else laugh around around you or anything like that if you have a friend like that man check on them because they not all right they not okay you know I'm saying it's always the goofy the goofy quiet wise you know what I'm saying check on check on them check on y'all our peoples man they not okay man and I feel for them it's just like when you walk around with y'all hey trying to hold your head I feel like making other people who laugh and happy man that was like that's kind of like it's kind of like a stable thing for depression I don't know why but it seemed like all the goofy people all the comedians and all the comedians they really be depressed as fuck like Robin Williams he was an on-set I don't know him you plan on a movie mr. doll fair and other classics and I'm saying I can't really thinking on top of my head no I can't really thinking off the top of my head only thing that came to my head was miss out her and he was a famous comedian he killed himself suicide and I feel like people don't take people don't a depression serious enough until it's too late you know what I'm saying until it's too late and every time I think about him like you know what I'm saying I feel like he really made other people laugh and smile but this nigga really was hurt and he really was hurt I'm just like I'm making this video I'm making this video too I don't know what's next one y'all I don't know what guy has the story for me I don't know what I should do next with my next movie honestly I'm just you know I'm just going through the motions right now you know it's kind of tough it's kind of tough man I've been talking to Chris a lot man he actually wants me to come down there he actually want me to come down there visit just you know sancious be around be around somebody you know I'm around jazz but it's just like that'd be like a breath of fresh air just going down to another state and just you know just hanging around somebody you know I know that shit might sound weird but it might sound weird because y'all fracking blood y'all you got just a nigga round but it's different when you'll be around somebody 24/7 like every day there's nothing bad about it but it is it feel good to get a knob some breath of fresh air you know I'm saying get out and hang around somebody ledge or something like that or it don't matter but I just I just might end up you know I'm saying I'm leaving I'm not sure you um I'm not even showing that but guys know I love her I love my daughter to death I don't play about neither one of them I just got some stuff to figure out on my own the reason I'm making this video and I'll probably make a cute I probably do the Q&A because I promise y'all I was gonna do the Q&A the reason I'm making this video is because I want to keep myself busy I don't want to feel how I felt last night because I really really really I was hurting like that shit was hurting so bad last night job I looked at my daughter crying you know I'm saying cuz you know I feel like I'm not a man I'm a man but I don't I didn't feel like a man at that moment you know I cry I didn't cry because I did you know I said I cried because this is my daughter you know what I'm saying like I love her like I never want her to go through anything that I've been through I expiry time a knit from the bottom of my heart I don't want her to go through anything like that man I just
