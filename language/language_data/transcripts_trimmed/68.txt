hey  guys  we are  not  perfect  at all  like not even close  you know like the other day i was saying how  there are still sins in my life that haven't been revealed  and  um  but you know he'll be revealed later  well  god  just revealed in me  how i lack  self control  it's funny cos a  control freak  i lack self control and  he allows us to get to a point where we need him  like  so much that it forces us to  to admit  you  know how helpless we are  how weak  we are  and that just happened  that's where we should be  that's true repentance  that's where you're like  acknowledging the truth of your  depravity and how you cannot save yourself and  then  you  turn to god  for salvation  that  is true repentance  that is the place where you  appreciate jesus the  most and  you just fall to your knees  cuz you're so grateful because you realize  how  screwed you'd be without him  basically  and that's what he taught when he came here  you know he was like you  guys think you keep the ten commandments  but you don't  because if you  even  look at somebody with lust you've already committed adultery  and if you  hate your brother  you've already  murdered him he  revealed the  depth of our depravity  he showed us how we  fail and  that was the whole point of the law and there's a scripture about it it says  that the law is a schoolmaster to  point us to christ and that's exactly what it was  it shows us how we  fail  it shows us that we need a savior  and then he died for us  and they  realized why  but even before he died for them they were like man who can be saved then if the law is that hard  and he said  with men  this is impossible  but with god all things are  possible  he  wasn't talking  about us  being perfect  in  our  flesh he was talking about our spirits  being perfected  but  by his  blood being shed on the cross  we received his  perfect righteousness by faith  when we put our trust in him  thank god we can put our trust in him because otherwise we would have no  chance because  once and can separate you  from god  falling into sin is  bad but there is good in it  because you realize that you need jeans is oliver again  and god always  brings  good from  the  bad he always turns a bad situation into something good  so  please keep me in your prayers i feel like i am being tested  big time right now and <unk> are going through a lot  of changes  and a lot of tests  and we need your prayers so  i  love you guys and i hope you have a blessed day lord part  of us
