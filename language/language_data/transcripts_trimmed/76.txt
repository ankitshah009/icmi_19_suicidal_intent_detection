i wanted to  i guess make a video of how i'm kind of feeling right now because  i'm  feeling absolutely useless as a  person and  i  not  sure exactly  how to  explain how i  i  really feel  but if i was to  be a hip or hit by bus all  right now i  would be perfectly  okay with that and i got  my hands  are  falling it's <unk> pathetic  so i  been  to  watching  some <unk> and  i don't know it just smacked me across the face as most feeling usually dude there's no real reason for it  you know  the movie that i was watching was happy and everything and then it ended up that there's just this moment in the movie where it's kind of like yeah god definitely what i would have really had  and it's something that i don't think that i will ever ever get because my mental  status is so far off  and i think it's  it's not necessarily i mean it was a relationship kind of movie okay but i mean it wasn't  it's not all that though it's kind of like what  i'm contributing nothing  at all  and by me putting myself out here  explaining to everybody  what's going on i'm putting myself out here for a  world of hurt  and  i  want  to  do this  not for that purpose of course  but i want to do this because i don't think people understand really  what it feels like to have  you know depression and have had it for  you know you're a whole entire life  i mean i think everyone goes through bouts of it every you know now and then and they bounce right out of it but being in a constant state of it is  is very  mentally draining  and i don't like it  i don't like the fact that my <unk> aren't working but i'm going through the side effects of every one of them  i don't want to do it anymore  i don't  i don't like the state of where i'm at  and i know that i am the sole person responsible for where it is i'm located  and in this life  but i don't really have  the mental capacity to change it  so it kind of throws  basically  my  whole entire life into  turmoil  probably will be for the next couple days i would think  but i  just  want  to  just  say hey i guess kind  of int a little bit  try to see if someone else understands what it is i'm going through and kind of understand that if someone was to say  would you take my kids cancer  and me die  i would be on it into  without  any questions  if  suicidal  it's not even the  word to be using right now because  it's  kind of beyond that step you know it's kind of like you feel it  and  you're waiting for the next  trigger  and it's going to just destroy me  it's going to destroy me  so this video  channel that i just started maybe  the end of  you  know  just a  few short <unk> of what my last  you know  feelings  thoughts  are  and unfortunately they're not all that great  but  here take your watch this or in the same seat that i'm sure that you'll probably  kind of understand  and more than likely i'll probably go to bed and i'll wake up a different human being  so  well  sorry  for throwing  this  out here like that i  just  thought that i'd share  and  you guys all have a  very good  night our good day and i  will talk to you guys  later  okay hi
