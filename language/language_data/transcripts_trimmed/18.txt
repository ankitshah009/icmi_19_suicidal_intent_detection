well from  let's cover the physical side of things so from a physical standpoint taking the actual overdose  is easy  you know  you just  take  the right amount of pills the right kind of pills  down up with some water  and then go to sleep  and then  the rest  is  is a mystery almost  you don't know what you  you're going into  you hope that you don't wake up  but  if you do wake up  you're gon na be  in a lot of pain  okay  when i woke up  i  i remember  first of all was in hospital  and a catheter  in my genitals  you know having a tube in there  so could  used  you know go to the toilet  that was pretty unpleasant in itself  my  my stomach or  my kidneys all of that downstairs area  was  painful  it  really hurt it  was  kind of like a clenching feeling like  when you've not eaten for a while when you start to feel like you know starting to tighten up  kind of feels like that a mixture of that and  needing the toilet really badly  it's just so much discomfort down there it's  it's horrible and  obviously having  i had a  tube  in each arm you know  <unk> so i believe they're called  a  drip has  obviously dripping water into my  it's my body to  try and flush out everything  obviously being hooked up  so  heart monitor as well  now you're just  lying there you can't really do anything you can't really move you feel so  <unk> it's  horrible  actually  and you  can see that the heart monitor in the hospital and  it's just  <unk>  <unk>  and  you just  you feel so  uneasy  you feel  it's horrible you know just lying in that hospital bed  you can't move because you've got  neither one each on  you  know you've got a catheter in  in there and  then we can do stare  and think  it's  horrible  it's really this comforting so  yeah from a physical standpoint  it hurts  it's  uncomfortable  you just want to move you want to get up but you can't because you feel so weak and so drained  and  then you start to get with  withdrawal from  if you're taking it if you take medication that's what you've overdosed on  let's get withdrawal cuz i'm not gon na let you take it you've already said too much  again that makes you feel nauseous  such  a  horrible feeling  you know  and  you don't feel like eating  hungry but you don't feel like eating  that's that's  unpleasant  so  from the physical standpoint  taken over those  horrible  from emotional  and a mental  perspective  is even worse  i  remember waking up  seeing my whole family  you know my  mum dad <unk>  i  know  i'm  waking up and  the  first thing i see is then  i start to cry  i  feel  ashamed  i also feel disappointed disappointed because  i failed  and what i said i failed  in ending my life  and  i felt like a failure because i've  put myself in a position where they can  see  that  i mean obviously  i look back now i'm  glad that i woke up  you know  i'm really glad that i did and i'm  here today  at the time i didn't want to wake up  so i just  felt miserable  i  felt depressed  i  felt so emotional you know i couldn't hold back the tears  just looking at all of them and you know i thinking  sorry for what i've done  it's  obviously they care so much  i  think you know they  they they cared so much about me and they say obviously still do  let's put them in that position was horrible and  again my own disappointment in myself  not carrying it out  and i was glad to see my family  surrounding me  knowing that i was loved  but  disappoint that i didn't follow through i mean obviously now not disappointed i'm glad  that i woke up  but  just laying there in that hospital bed  off the sing  after seen the  looks on their faces i can't forget you know just  sad  shocked  hoping that i would pull through  folks so uneasy  emotionally i felt  ashamed of myself  i felt bad for them i felt like a disappointment for them i felt disappointed myself for not caring  yeah following through and  ending it
