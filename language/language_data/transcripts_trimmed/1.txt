 in my  pain  every  day  and it's like  i don't know part of me is it's just like  fighting or resisting  things  avoiding things  so  i live with my parents and i can't talk to my parents because  if  i  say i'm unhappy or miserable  those  be like  well  <unk> should have listened to us and became an  accountant  or  you need to go to a job fair everything with them is based around like  money  earning  a living  living  i just can't talk to  them  about emotions at all like  like i said before when i was  depressed in  college  i told  my  dad he said when i was your age i didn't have time to be depressed and like  you know talking about how he worked  <unk> hours like you  know he slept like two hours at night cuz he had two jobs in college  and  um  i'm not just so weird that like  that generation  they were in survival mode  and it's like then you have  <unk>  our generation  who was supposed to be like  benefiting from the fruits of  all their hard work but  if you don't have any like  emotional support  or foundation  it's  like so  impossible  to  like  grow  and  just  live  and be an adult  i  listened to  a mental illness happy hour <unk> which i'm plugging again i made video  about it but he's big on  group <unk>  and are  going to group therapy  and  i do want to experience what he's talking about but like one i like a group therapy and it  was like ninety dollars a week  i don't know maybe i just haven't  found the right  the  right  group  but  ninety dollars a week like  i thought group therapy was supposed to be cheaper  than  individual therapy  because i actually  have  a discounted rate  the  therapist i see now so i only pay forty nine dollars  a session  which i think is pretty good so  i thought  group therapy  should be less than that but apparently not  and  also part of me is like  embarrassed like  like i  don't  know  i have this thing where i feel like i'm spoiled and  and  i'm behind other people my age who  are  like married  or on their second marriage they have kids  i  mean technically people my age could have kids that are like  getting ready  to  graduate  high school actually i didn't i didn't meet somebody  two  years younger than me and she has  a son that's like  you know just sort of high school  so  it's just  crazy like and  you feel like you're behind and  so  me  i  like isolate  and then it's like  i fall  even  farther  behind  so  it's like really rough  yeah  but anyways  luckily i have  because i have social anxiety  i  feel like  this  these <unk> are my way of  getting my  my emotional state and pain  out into  the world  and hopefully  realizing that i'm  i'm not that  bad  yeah  so  so that's my deal
