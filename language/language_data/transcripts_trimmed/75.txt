themes is that  we all have points where our creativity breaks down a bit we all have points so self doubt and we all have points of  just  where we're feeling low in life  so i wanted to make a video to  kind of convey some knowledge because i'm actually doing  i'm actually doing really well right now  i'm in a  good place in my life i feel  i feel fulfilled creatively and i feel like i'm  on the path to doing something  more  and  that that's owed largely in part to  the  fact that i'm not taking everything so seriously as i used to  i'm  trying to be more like myself i'm trying to be more open  about my feelings  but  i also wanted to  make a video that you guys could watch if you're ever feeling  low and you're ever feeling like  the world is coming down around you  first and foremost is that  it is absolutely okay  to feel down  it's absolutely okay to feel sad  you don't have to put up  a front  of happiness you don't have to put up  a fake wall  of  doing fine  you can  be real about your emotions you can  you can be honest with yourself and you can be honest with those around you  you don't have to worry about burdening  those around you  with your sadness  you don't have to <unk> it always  and  number two  you have to identify what it really is  that's causing your sadness we've had a few speakers here at the creator summit one of them was erik barker who was  talking in great length about  how success measures towards happiness  and  a lot of it you know  isn't  a competition between happiness and success it's  it's about using those two things in conjunction with each other  now  you feeling down maybe  the result of someone  bullying you or the result of you bullying yourself  and  one of those things is something that you can change  and one of those things is something that you can try to change you  know  others bullying you is a problem  of  the  environment that you're in  and the steps to be  taken to change that or  harder than one might think but  even harder than that are the steps to stop bullying yourself  which is the one thing that you definitely can change but probably the one thing that we all  do more than  anything else so  identifying if  your  depression or your sadness is coming from  a place of  internal hate  is  something that plagues a lot of us  and  and  also it's  it's not something that needs to be fixed right away  some some of us  get down on ourselves i can me myself included because  we expect so much out of ourselves  you know we want to do so much therefore  we're upset when we do less  and  that's a poisonous way of thinking and it's a poisonous  like a route to  take yourself down because it only means that you don't celebrate your successes enough and you only  admonish your failures  and that's no way to live so  if you're  if you're ever feeling this way just remember that you  you can choose to forgive yourself  for transgressions you can choose to forgive yourself for failures  you can choose to  be above  your own hate  and  take that as an example for the hate  in the world around you  a  lot of bullying these days are  people that are projecting their own hate  on themselves upon others so that they can escape their pain  and  you know  that's no way to live but that's someone else's problems if you're feeling down about yourself then  many times you just need to forgive yourself  but there's also environmental factors  that aren't you  being mad at yourself for being  upset with yourself they're  their <unk> things money's not enough  you know  your home life isn't solid here  your your relationships are breaking down you don't feel like you have friends to surround yourselves with  and  in those times  i don't have  an anecdotal piece of advice  or words that are gon na fix your problem  or  even likely to make you feel better  but  if it does bring you any solace just know  that  i  really  honestly truly believe  that you can get through  it  i honest believe  that you're strong enough to  pursue your goals and  to  conquer your dreams and  go farther than you ever thought possible but the only way to do it  is to keep trying  no matter what no matter what gets in your way no matter  what adversity you face if you keep trying  if you never give up  if you always pursue that thing which makes you  happier  the thing that makes you burn inside you for  the  the ambition that you have the projects that you see on the horizon the dreams  that you hope to achieve  if you keep your eye on them and not just on  the dream itself because if you obsess about the dream and what it will mean when you  get there  you'll ignore all of the obstacles on the path  like really focus on the whole picture of everything if you're trying to do something and you're  constantly met with failure or  your  friends don't believe in you or your
