 every thursday is the day that i do my radio show  and  you know i call it a radio show it's really like a glorified  <unk> you know i  get it up on the <unk> and <unk>  and then it goes out  <unk> times on <unk>  to you know the international audience there  and this week's show  i mean i was really feeling  it like the last few weeks i  wasn't  really feeling the best  one week i had some terrible anxiety one week i had some bad <unk> so i was able to put something together  but  you know it could have been a little better but i was just inhibited by just how i was doing physically  this week i was feeling it  and i said you know what  i'm gonna work hard at this  i'm gonna get a good show out for everyone  and  and you know i did i really put a lot of time into it  i worked for a few days i actually made the show about an hour longer than it usually is  where i just i had a lot to talk about  got some  good music played  and i was just on a roll  i got the show set up  i  edited it  you know  i really wanted to promote it too  so i was trying to get the links you know to where it  it streams on tune in  and the <unk> frequencies and listening times to everyone that wrote in  you know i  was working for <unk> hours straight i was getting to about <unk> or <unk> <unk> i was responding  and i thought yeah i mean i'm really on a roll today  i was feeling this show  i'm gonna get it out i'm gonna get it promoted  and i was exhausted by the end of it  you know i was  working through the night  finally fell asleep  i woke up just in time for the first broadcast airing  to  you know start checking it out and make sure everything's going all right  and i'm not hearing in  the  show it's just it's it's  dead air  i checked the tune in stream and it's just silence there's nothing there  i checked the short wave frequency you know where the radio station is supposed to be broadcasting it  there's nothing  i'm scratching my head i'm trying to think oh wait a minute you know i  i know i sent them the file  i know i  you know i submitted the show to them so so what's going on  so i sent the manager  of the radio station an email  you know not  not angry we're on really good terms  and i just said you know well you know what's going on is everything all right with the  computers you know i just wanted to check and my  my i don't see my show airing what's uh  what's up  and  then he  broke it to <unk> said  listen you know we  we kind of have a problem  someone hacked into our  computer system  deleted or i think <unk>  all the files  that they had every audio program  and then was demanding money  to get them restored  and they said you know look we're dead in the water here  we can't even access any of the shows  that  we're supposed to air  we're not going to give in to this guy's demands so we need to get a whole new computer system set up  and unfortunately  it's not going to be <unk>  until maybe  maybe tomorrow at the earliest  which in short  means that  everything that i was working on  and promoting and doing  over the last few days for this radio show  was for nothing  and it was due to circumstances  outside my control  outside the control  of this radio station  it  was  just some hacker  that decided to screw with them  and  you know just try to get a ransom kind of like  you know you remember those old viruses that used to infect your computer and say it was locked by the <unk>  unless they give him like five hundred bucks and you know  that kind of deal  same type of thing  i knew that it wasn't  my fault  it wasn't the fault of the folks who work at the radio station  they were working to get it  fixed  man i couldn't help but  feel so disappointed  i was i was  feeling disappointed  i was feeling down  i was feeling frustrated  i was shaking my head and i was just saying  damn it  you know  i spent so  much time  so much energy  i was just  trying so hard to get a good show out  to all these people who were looking forward to it  and  it's not gonna happen  yeah there's a few people that's still tuned in on the <unk>  but i know the tens of thousands of people listen on <unk>  and on <unk>  they weren't notified that this was gonna happen no one knew that  it was all gonna go down  and i was just kicking myself i was just  i was just saying  you know  total loss  just a complete and total loss i kept kicking myself  like  i  kept i just kept  beating myself up  getting down on myself
