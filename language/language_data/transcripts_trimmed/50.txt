sent me a link to a video that she made for me  and  i'm  absolutely  beside myself to move it  you know other people  are touched by my story  in a way  i mean  ah  i'm beside myself  and it's given me the push and kind of the inspiration  to share my story  and to tell you guys exactly what happened  and the reason i want to do this  is  and and  the reason i've been contemplating doing this for so long even though i said i'd never do it  is because i feel like it would help more people  and then it could possibly like  you know hinder me in the future or  the boys  deacon knows  about it now  not to this extent but he understands  why  his dad's out of the picture  so i feel like you know in the future obviously he know more and  maybe probably even more than what you know  i'm gon na share but  i want to share my story with you guys and  explain to you guys why  why i'm divorced and maybe  i mean  i'm sure some people have already kind of figured it out and put pieces  together and  you know able to  understand why  but  yeah  i want to share it because i feel like it might  it might help  it might empower somebody  it might make a difference in their life  like it has mine granted  you know my life is  is harder than it's ever been  but  at the same time i know that i did the right thing and i did the right thing for not only myself but for my boys  and for the safety of my kids  everything  you name it like i just i know that it was the right  it was the right decision so  um  okay  so about the men it was  like the middle of drake's  pregnancy  i noticed some weird  weird behavior from my ex and  weird in this sense that like you know  he'd get home and he'd go use the bathroom for an hour just like be in the bathroom for  an  hour  just  you know odd behavior but nothing that i thought  too much of  but he was like a little off he's a little jittery he was a little off  i think there's a video  it's  probably off but if you guys remember i tried to play a spaghetti prank on him  and i recorded it  and there were  i had bought these noodles from like  world market that were  like  two or three feet long  and i just thought it'd be funny to like be trying to eat a spaghetti noodle and like  have it be three feet long  so  i did that and in that video  a really good friend of mine actually had watched it and her and her husband had  commented to me me and he's really jittery he's really weird  is everything okay  and i  you know  even then  didn't think that much of it  and as  as time had gone on  i started to know like we're really financially struggling and at that time  i had a great job he had a great job we shouldn't have been  but his checks were  you know a little bit less and less and less and  i was trying to do more and more to like pick up the slack and i  again i didn't think anything of it because i thought that  you know he was just putting his  checks in the bank  well  this one on  and  shortly after that time it kind of evolved into  a really hot temper  and  to where  everything made him  snap  and just  flip out  and  yell and scream i actually remember having a birthday  i was pregnant i was with deacon in the bathtub  and i was just hysterically crying because  he had  just completely flipped out on us about nothing so  i  have a horrible memory  horrible memory  but  i do remember a few things and that was  that was one of them specifically i just remember trying to like hide my face in the shower curtain  so that deacon didn't see me so upset  and stuff like that carried on  for a long time  so the  the  the verbal abuse of it  it started getting really ugly  and it wasn't something that you know i was necessarily comfortable with  but i blamed things like stress  i blamed things like  you know work  stuff like that  and i found excuses for everything  more and  more he didn't want to hang around  the family he was  working six or seven days a week  <unk> hour days  we just weren't seeing him  and when we did he was ugly  and again  money kept getting tighter and tighter this just kept getting worse and worse it was like a snowball effect  fast  forward up a little bit to drake's  drake's birth  yeah and  at the birth  i remember  my birth  video <unk> that
