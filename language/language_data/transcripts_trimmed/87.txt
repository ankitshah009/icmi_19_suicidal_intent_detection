well  they're  a lot of the time  i  think of myself as  ugly  and  i don't think that that's a bad thing  a lot of the time is just something that i can accept  and be cool with  and get on and i can just be okay with it  just like a lot of overweight people don't want to be told that they're not fat  i don't want to be told that i'm not ugly  i don't want to call myself unconventionally pretty  i am  happy  a lot of the time  to  think of myself  as ugly  i think  ugliness only becomes a problem when you  let it get in the way of your life end of living  i can't say that i've never let that happen but  it's something that i'm dealing with and i'm generally okay with  when my appearance really  gets to me  and  i'm feeling really  gross  about it  i try to remember a few things  one is that i am beautiful in some way because i'm a living thing  and i think living things to me at least have some inherent beauty  there was an interview with johnny <unk>  a  long time ago which i saw on <unk> somewhere  and i think he was asked something like what is your greatest turn on  and he said  breathing  you might have just been saying that to  be funny or whatever  but  it's kind of true there's something  really sexy and really beautiful about being alive  and when you think about being alive and you put that into perspective and you just think about the smallest and biggest thing  just breathing  prettiness seems to become so insignificant  and just  tiny  tiny  so one way i can saw myself is by reminding myself  that  i am beautiful because i am alive  because  i am breathing  and  that  is  amazing  another way that i can soul myself or deal with it is  by putting things  again into perspective  i think about the universe and i think about human beings as a species  and how  actually  ridiculous we look  other mammals  and  i've got four legs  and have  some kind of really elegant gait  or  i mean even cows  just seem  like  kind of  magical beings  whereas humans are covered in hair but you can't see most of it you just see like stuff that comes out of their heads randomly  we've got these facial features that are just  like very strange even  when looking at beautiful people if you look at them  long enough  it just starts to look like  ridiculous  to me at least we don't have this elegance or majestic beauty as a species  that  lions  have or  birds or  anything  when you put it into this  perspective everything  just seems absurd  it's not absurd to recognize  that you're not  way that  a lot of other people look  but  it's absurd  when you  waste too much time on it  when you look at the perspective of being part of this kind of  silly looking species  on this planet  in this solar system in this universe that is huge and  contains life forms that we haven't even encountered yet  and that are completely foreign to us think about that  and then i come back  to  my face  in the mirror  and  god i  wish  i just had  cheekbones or some kind of  facial definition  it's  it's  tiny  another thing that goes along with the breathing  and the living  is that  we are living creatures which means that we're not just alive but we're doing things  even when we're not consciously trying or aware of things we're breathing  and when you actually do things other than that when you  get out and you're doing stuff  and  when you're really engaged and excited in something  i feel like the last thing  that i  care about is how i look  i never want to get into this place where i feel like what i look like is more important than what i do  and  it seems  like it's a lot  easier to let myself  not do anything  and to  hold back because i don't feel  that  i have  a certain appearance for some reason that  that exempts me from having to do things  but it makes me any less capable  but it  doesn't it might make it harder  and  and it might take  work on my part but  being beautiful is not an accomplishment  and being ugly have to stop you from making accomplishments  i talked about the show my mad fat diary the other day  but i didn't touch on  one of the main basic reasons that i really loved it because i just didn't feel i had enough time and it didn't fit  in the video  but basically that show  is just this  grand  statement the work of art  showing that you can be fat or you can be ugly or you can be whatever it is that you are and you can still live  and you can still find happiness and you can still be hopeful  and you can make relationships and have friends  and  have lots of fun and  be a good human being  and grow and  be happy  and  do the things that you want to do  and that means  a lot to me  i don't think that we get that message enough  or when we do get it it's coming from  the people who are already seen it's really pretty so it doesn't just doesn't have the same  effect on me  that show
