 hey guys to raymond  this is my first video  and today i wanted  to  talk to you about  life  and why i think it's pointless  but first  i  want to  tell you a  little bit about myself  i'm <unk> years old i'm <unk>  i'm  into like  metal music and rock and stuff like that  some days i like include <unk>  enemy as  i  lay dying  bullet for  my valentine  disturbed five finger death punch  slipknot avenged sevenfold  suicide silence the old linkin park nothing new linkin park  the only new lincoln park album i like is the  hunting party  and  yeah so  i wanted  to  talk about why i  think life is pointless  and why i don't  think  life is worth living  well hold on  what  was  i  gon  na say  oh yeah  um  fuck it again  oh yeah  i  feel like everybody's life is the same  because like  well first off i think  it feels like  life revolves around like jobs and stuff like that  cuz like when you're older you have to get a job and get money to work to live and stuff  and that applies to everybody and i think that's pointless  and  i just think everybody's life is pointless because  it's all the same you  you're born you grow up  you get a job  no  you're born you grow up you go to school  you get a job  you probably get married  you probably have shit  sorry  about  that  i  was just sitting on a  container and  i fell  in it yeah  just  disregard  that  what was  i  saying so you're born  you grow up you  go to  school  you got a  job  you probably get married and you probably have kids and then  you  die i mean doesn't  that seem pointless like like since it  applies  to everybody  and i  and everybody says that  the point of life is being happy and everything but i think being happy is pointless because one minute you're happy  then you're sad then you're happy then you're sad  then you're happy then you're sad and so on so forth i mean doesn't that get annoying it's like wouldn't you rather feel nothing at all  and  yeah i just  think that's all pointless  because  everybody gets a job and goes to school and everything  and it just seems pointless i mean  not everybody gets to be like  famous or anything like  it being like the bands i just mentioned before  and like they don't  get  to  become  like actors easily  it's  not easy being  in the entertainment industry because you have to  be like really lucky to have that  but yeah  it's just since  most people  have like a job at like places like shop right <unk> target  or a hair salon or whatever just  i have a job at shop right and i think it's kind of boring but  i mean i just started there like a couple weeks ago so i'm  just getting used to it  tomorrow i'm going to disney world  so  i won't be there  for like a week or so  and yeah  just  yeah i just think life is pointless because everybody  has to  like get a job to live i think that's bullshit  because  people should do other stuff with their life  i feel like the world just revolves around money and  that's  stupid and pointless  so  yeah
