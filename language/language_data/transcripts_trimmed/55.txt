 and  the reason for why i haven't been filming  so basically these last  couple months i just really haven't been feeling  <unk> myself you could say  i just wanted to make this video because  you know there may be someone else out there who is feeling the same way  as me  and even if this doesn't help you which hopefully it does but  if this doesn't help anyone  at least if you know  you're not always feeling a hundred percent  then you're definitely not alone  in that  so first off i just want to say  nothing  like really bad has happened anything like that  i am totally fine and i'm definitely starting to feel  a lot better these last couple of weeks  i'm actually feeling  pretty good right now  and i've just been feeling  you could say  stuck  and just like  very  stagnant  it just feels like  i'm going  nowhere  and  all these things that i'm trying to do  in my life  and all this if it i'm trying to put in  with my career  and just live life  in relationships and things in general  it just feels  stuck  and  like  nothing is  working  so  i guess i've just been feeling a little down  i know it will go through this but  you  know usually i have lots of video ideas and i'm really  excited about filming  but  more recently  i've just been really struggling to find that level of motivation  but only with <unk>  but just with  life  itself  i guess  and sometimes you just feel like you're in an environment that  isn't pushing you  and you just feel  a bit <unk>  and uninspired  and  it affects  your mood  and it affects you  i think that living  just being alive being a human being  on this  planet  is all about sharing our experiences  and connecting and talking to one another  so that we can help each other grow  and i feel like  it would be selfish of me to  keep this to myself  if that makes sense  it's really great that so many more <unk> are talking about these kind of things now and are talking about mental health and all of that  because it is so important  i'm not trying to make you feel bad for me i'm not trying to get attention from this  like this isn't anything  particularly bad i'm not like  super depressed or anything  it's just  i just feel like i'm stuck  and  just a bit down and i know everyone goes through that so  just want to kind of share where i'm at and see if they can  help anyone else out as well  since i haven't been feeling like myself  i  promised myself  that i wouldn't make another video  until i felt  a hundred percent  like me again  like happy danny  even though how i've been feeling isn't something super serious  to be concerned about  or anything  i still didn't feel right  coming back on this channel  and just making like the  usual  travel or comedy or whatever those types of <unk> that i usually do  i just felt like if  i  was gon na come in here  sit down with all my video  and turn this camera on  i honestly  i couldn't just be like  hey guys how's it going my name is danny  and welcome back  you know  because  that's how generally baby because i'm  usually quite a bubbly  can an outgoing person and  i get really excited about  talking to you guys but  it didn't feel genuine  because  i haven't been feeling in that mood  so i thought that you know next week and it's gon na be fine i'm gon na be feeling  awesome again  so week rolls around  i still feel stuck in the slump and i'm like  i'm not filming like this  another week  and now it's been a couple of months that have rolled around  and  i am feeling better now  but i didn't just like randomly wake up one day and be  super excited and super happy and like  yeah let's  go  let's film a video  i was kind of waiting and waiting  to feel that way  but then i just thought  what's  the point in that because  it's almost like i'm just putting on this  persona and that's character  and i'd only come on to this channel when i'm just going to  be this super bubbly  like person that just doesn't have  you know any kind of  negative emotions or  feeling  and um  i've been kind of getting sick of just not  filming anything so  i thought hey  this is  me  this is real  and  we can't always be  that bubbly  persona that a lot of people do  and  i put on  on their <unk> because  into the day  we're just real people  talking to a camera i don't say that  most <unk>  aren't  a hundred percent how they are  in their <unk> in real life  all the  time for sure  but  i've always just wanted to be  as braille as  possible on this channel  that i can be  otherwise i just  kind of don't see the point in doing it if it's not going to be genuine  i feel like just  shoving all of that under the rug  and you know just pretending it's okay and coming on here and trying to be that  person  wasn't the right thing to do  i don't want my channel to ever just be
