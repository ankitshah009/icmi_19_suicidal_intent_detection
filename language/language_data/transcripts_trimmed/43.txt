 in the it  world and  i am in a competitive field  and  good jobs are hard to come by sometimes but  the  primary positive  that i think  i always you know looked at on top of  that  was given my  history if you  will  the  job that i had up until the  point of  this queen  was  secure  because in the federal government for the most part  unless you're really messing up  the likelihood of you losing your job is slim benign  they have to literally  you  i'm sure you guys have been around people that are on  federal  but  it comes a time  where  you have to ask yourself  is this really worth it  is this worth  you know the energy that i'm pouring into it is this  where i want to  be  and  ultimately  when i say  given  my history  i don't think  i've left a job  on the mutual  you know  oh  well you know i'm just going somewhere else  and pursue  this blah blah blah  i don't think i've ever  left  a  corporate america job  on that note  from  the  military  my job with <unk> after  job what after  it's all been because  people  tend to believe that  they can treat you any kind of way  they can  talk to you any kind of way  and basically you're going to excuse me you're going to tolerate it  for a paycheck  and  unfortunately and sadly  a lot of people  will  i cannot  begin to say  how  elated i was  to quit  and yeah i  quit in a  very  epic fashion  but  it was well deserved given the history of  what i was  dealing with  you know  working there  and at the  end of the day i'm not gon na allow any place to put me in the position  that  my health is in jeopardy  you know when it comes down to it you have to ask yourself  is this place worth my health  this place where my sanity  am i  going through all of these things  excuse me  all of these things for what  for the benefits  yeah i mean  incredible benefits of top notch  but  at the end of the day if it's your job that's  making you sick or making you  more sick  what's the  point  defeating the purpose  so  either way  i left  and  my being there  really made me realize  some  things  and  that's what i was about to go into but  i will start off with that  when i said  you know given my history and how  for the most part i've left jobs  i've come to learn about myself  that  me and corporate america don't work  me and general corporate in it and i can't even say it's corporate america  the kind of  people that occupy  supervisory positions or positions where believe they have this perceived level of authority  over you  we don't mix  because i'm not the kind of person that's gon na allow somebody to just  talk to me any kind of way especially someone who cannot do my job  you see in my current situation  then i just left  i had a supervisor that  knows  shit  about it  not even in the  textbook context  but you want to tell me how to do my job  you see  i don't have a problem with suggestions but when you don't know what someone's job  entails  and you don't know how to do their job and you're their supervisor here's some advice for anybody that may be in that position  trust that your employee knows what they're doing especially if they've been there a long time  allow them to do their job and sure that they keep you up to date on what's going on but other than that  if you don't know how to do the job leave people alone because at the  end  there's a what happens when that person leaves you see i was the only  it  for the past six years  so  you  replace the body  you can't replace the expertise  because that's a level of continuity  for that place  so  i'm just over it  and at the end of the day  that's  that's just that  me and corporate america don't get along because  you have people in their perceived  perception of authority that wants to abuse it and think that everybody's going to just tolerate  it i'm gon na go ahead and say  about <unk> percent of people probably will tolerate it  i'm not part of that <unk>
