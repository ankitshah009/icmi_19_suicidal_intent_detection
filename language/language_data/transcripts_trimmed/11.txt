 i was depressed  hi you guys so  today i'm going to be making  a little bit more of a  serious video  i'm  going to talk about  my experience with depression  now i've been super open  about my eating disorder on this channel as well as on my blog as well as just in person  because i feel like that's something not a lot of people talk about  and i haven't really said much about my  experience with depression  and not because i'm ashamed of it or anything like that i just  i don't know i just haven't really  said anything i don't think there's really a reason for it  but the other day  i  saw  a tweet from a girl that i knew that  essentially just said  i can't stand depressed people  just be happy it's your choice  and i kind of like hit me that so many people are  uneducated  about depression  and then to go along with that i watched the last episode of <unk> reasons why  yesterday and  i can honestly say that it wrecked  me  and i'm sure everyone else  cried  you know like everyone was it was a sad episode so i'm sure everyone else cried  and was upset about it or something  but i was just thinking about  like this just really happens people really get to a point where they're so depressed  that they want to end their life  and so i just thought this could maybe be informative  about what it's  like to have depression so maybe you don't have depression  but you might know someone who does and you don't you have no idea what they're going through and you  may be it like makes you uncomfortable to talk to them about it  so i just  kind of wanted to share this  maybe it would help someone  so  my depression kind of went hand in hand  with my eating disorder  and before i start i do want to say that depression does run in my family  so it can be kind of like passed down genetically  and  so anyways  when i was going to treatment i really  i really really didn't want to go to treatment  i had no interest in going and it was just something  i  i really really fought  and  in fighting this  it's just all  i just felt like everything like tumbling  right nothing was going right which kind of caused me to spiral into this depression  so my best friend had kind of forced me to tell my parents about my eating disorder  which made me really uncomfortable and so upset and then  my parents were upset and then i started feeling like i had caused all these issues  and it just downward spirals into this depression  so  this is kind of  how it felt for me  so to start  i just felt like  i had let everyone down  i felt like i was a problem  to everything that was going on like i was the cause of  all the issues that were happening  in my household with my friends  and i just kept thinking like  like people's lives would be so much easier without me  i wouldn't be here to cause all this chaos in these issues  and like my parents wouldn't have to pay for another kid  and they would be like  better off financially  and they wouldn't my mom wouldn't be so stressed out about me  and these were the thoughts that just kept going on in my mind and i can't tell you how many times i repeated the phrase i don't want to be here anymore  i don't want to do this anymore  and  i just repeated them  all the time  in my mom was so  worried you guys  she  was so freaked out  as any parent would be if you have a child coming home saying i don't want to do this anymore i don't want to be here anymore i don't want to do this anymore i don't want to be here anymore  over and over and over again and just sobbing  and that's what it was like  i just was like crying all the time and i was  i don't want to be here i don't want to do this anymore  and of course this was all during the phase of me  going to  patient like treatment  so i just kept repeating  i don't want to be here anymore i don't want to do the  same work  to  the point where my mom got so freaked out  she slept in my room with me every night because she was afraid i was going to hurt myself  every  night  she slept in there  for  i don't even remember how long  like  i want to say a few weeks to like a month or something  just every single night because she was so afraid  and then so the crying happened a lot at first and then kind of  after a while i wasn't crying as much and i just didn't even want to get out of bed  i didn't go  i  didn't go to school for i can't remember  so it was like two or three weeks but i did not go to school because i just physically couldn't get myself to get  out of bed  i don't even know the words for that i just  you hear people say they can't get out of bed in the morning but i just like  because there's really no way to describe what you're feeling it's like i just  i can't  i can't do it  today and it's not like i was getting bullied or anything at school it's not like  school is this terrible place i was just in this  <unk> of like  i can't  i don't want to do this anymore  i guess to kind of  help
