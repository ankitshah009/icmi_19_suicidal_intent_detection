 i  don't  let  it  keep  saying no my <unk>  i'm  gon na go back to regular content  or  not  regular khan did because they don't have for clear content in my channel but  you  know  like  recording all the things that i want to record for this channel  sharing all the stuff that i wanted to  do  on this channel  and i never do  i  just want to talk about it a little  bit  because  i lost motivation  concepts though  it's not something that just happened this year but last year as well  sorry i'm losing  motivation in  reading and  just watching <unk> shows which sounds  weird  and  it's not because i don't like it it's just cuz  i  prefer to waste my time  to  everything basically why do  i  have  to do  anything  right now i  want to  believe that i  can do you too  it's  one of the  biggest dreams in mind  like  i'm not explaining it just  it's like  something that i wish i had hoped for  because i had hope for it in the  past notes  it's terrible  filming it's  one of my passions  you know  music music is my  music is one of my biggest passions and then  i just love music a lot and i wish i wish  i could do music for a living i wish i could  or how to sing because i don't know how to sing for just learn  how  to  play  the  guitar properly or the  drums and  music  motivation  i'm  so passionate  about  music i still want to  give miss a  hope  that there's something  i can do about it you know but there  is some  feels terrible  i  cried a lot  during the past month  nothing seems right anymore my  existence  i'm sort of  floating around  houses  i don't want  to  go back to  my  country either it's  terrible over  there i feel like i can be myself i don't have goals over there but i don't have goals here  either so what's the  one  you're going on with life you know  i  was  in the hospital you know  that i'm not  planning on going back in there  and that's sort of what  scares me and  what keeps me away of trying to do something because  when i tried to do something again people  were smarter than me and they stopped me they managed to stop me and  that was not fun  you know  but i convinced them that i was gon na be okay  and i mean i'm not okay  i'm just alive  i'm alive in the outside  like a  dead  body that  needs to be carrying around  me  hope i  almost  every day  and  pain  is  just too strong because  i  lost the  people that i  care about  the  most because  of my own fault i want to believe  that  i could do stuff for  myself i  can
