 okay  so  today  balls  today  i  woke  up  satin today  i  woke up  depressed which was weird it was like it's weird how some days  you just wake up and you feel  it and you're like today today is not my day  huh  yeah  wasn't my day  it's actually not been my day the past two days  which is weird  because there's a lot of good things happening in my life  but i have a really hard time seeing the positive  which is  also weird because i talked about seeing the positive  a lot  i'm  not trying to be hypocritical  i just have trouble too  so i asked why are we sitting down  i wan na chat  we're just gon na which is kind  of just gon na  chill  and i mean  i'm boiling right now  and i decided to hit  the hot chocolate  which is boiling i don't know why i keep sipping  it so i saw my friend  i don't know if might know it's not my friend  she's more of like  an acquaintance i would love to be her friend  but i don't know if she's  my friend  dodie  i did a panel with her  at  <unk> we've met a few times  we're nice people  we say hi  she made a video  called i am depressed today  and  i thought it was amazing  i thought it was so  so real and  i've been finding myself  watching these type of <unk>  a lot recently  because  i've been waking up in this mood  and super weird  it's helped it's helped me a lot  it tell me a lot knowing that other people are going to it to  really helps me and i think that's what  you guys watch this channel  and i think that that's the main reason why i wanted to make a video i just wanted to sit down and talk  cuz i haven't a really hard time thinking about like what to film  not that  it matters  anyways  i don't really have a schedule anymore  i  have  this problem  where  if i'm successful  i always find a way to bring myself down because i don't think i should have that high of  expectations in my life like a really really good thing happened to me  last week a  massive thing  out of this world i can't what it is  i'm not trying to be that you two are saying that this students happening but it can't tell you because they don't even know what's happening  yet but like this huge thing happened and  i  can't seem to like it anymore  i can't seem to  enjoy the idea of it and it stresses me up and i  think negatively  it's a problem  i know  another thing that's kind of positive is that  i've been working out  a lot recently and if you follow me on <unk> not saying actually you should probably go follow me on <unk> it's at joey guinea  it looks like this  it's really  cool  i love talking you guys on  there  and i've been working out a lot recently just because i wanted to get my body  into a shape where  you know  i like it  that's that's literally  the only reason  why i'm doing it and  i find them very hard on myself at the same time like i'm like  oh i don't have like the packs of this guy  and i think like a lot a lot there's a lot of stigma  in  men's health we always look at that cover or we look at that  <unk> picture whatever we're like wow we want to be that  guy  i want to be that big you know  or small  whatever you want in life and  it's really been stressing me out  lately  but like it's a good thing  i don't know when to stop  another thing  that have been kind of going about lately  and i haven't really told the main channel this  i got into school  again  which is really cool  yeah i  got into like a really cool program it's kind  of like my dream program right now  for school  and  i don't know if i want to go  not because i don't like to school i mean i've already graduated from college if  you don't already know  but it's just like i don't know if i want to  look back is that taking a step  back i know education  like  my problem is i'm  not from this my problem  i know everything  i know the the reason why we feel things and everything like that and why i'm feeling the way i do  and there's like pros and cons to everything i and i  get both sides of like why i shouldn't go and why i should go  but i'm like  i have a really hard  time figuring what the middle is  i'm  not asking for you to  help me  but like i don't know  if you relate to this a comment down below  yeah so i'm really straight i'm stressing  about school  everyone's like go  go  go  and i'm like what  is it for what if  i'm putting a hole to my career  what if  i'm taking a step backwards  what if  i get this  this crazy opportunity  and i'm stuck in school  and then the other side of me is thinking like well it's just school  you can leave it  and do it again  if this opportunity is that amazing you just cool  and so i'm like okay i'll go to school but then  the other side  comes back with another point in this side comes i go  and it's just this  oh  i don't even want to  go  i'll figure it out  i haven't cleaned  lately  i'm a big clean person  i spilt hot chocolate the powder and i still haven't cleaned it  i'm looking  at it and it's bugging me but i probably won't do it until tomorrow  actually i'll probably do it tonight  but  i hate i don't clean  anymore  because  three people  three people came over to my place  and they're like well  you clean  and i  felt really insecure and i'm not trying to be a hypocrite iii  <unk> today and i was like i hate people who  preach things that they don't
