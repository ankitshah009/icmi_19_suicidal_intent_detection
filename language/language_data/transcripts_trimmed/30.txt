you know some people will never understand what it's like to  be  at your  breaking point  a  point where you feel the  only way for you to  escape this insufferable pain  is  ceasing to exist  music  some people can't believe to  the  some people have their religious beliefs  in booze  and  they  can't see outside of that  i  was against suicide at one time  believe it or not  you  know  people never want to  die  they  just can't find a solution to the pain and they want to  escape  sometime people feel like they've exhausted all of their options  and  i  think  that a  lot of times in life we want to believe that there is a solution to every situation  a fairy tale story  and ending but the  fact of the matter is  some things are incorrigible  every situation  you cannot repair  every situation and thing is not <unk> music and  i  think  once people are able to understand that first  they  will  begin to  see while suicide is a option for certain people  well but at least begin to understand the  state of mind that  individuals are in when they consider such things  it bothers me sometimes people say they can't relate to other people with shoes and some situations you know  i don't want to  generalize here  and make general statements  because some of this is circumstantial  but  some situations really are not hard to understand and i don't think that you have to be  in those situations  to be able to  understand the level  of pain that a person is in dori  example  some people ignorantly tell me  j i don't understand what it's like to have very severe anxiety  you know you can't expect me to understand i can't believe it i don't have it bullshit  everybody has anxiety  at some point in time in their life  the only thing that separates my anxiety from yours is that i have a disorder  he mental illness  which means that my anxiety occurs  more frequently  it's more intense  and  it occurs in  situations  in which it shouldn't occur  that's what makes it a disorder  where you guys have normal anxiety you may experience anxiety when you're preparing for tests  and college are really important to us  that's gon na help to  you  know  help  you  earn your degree  but if your doctor called you in and  told you that they had who are  running <unk> because  they  feel it may be some  something cancerous in your breasts  or tell you that you may have a fatal disease  and  you have to come in  to the doctor's office to receive the results  wherever your mother father were loved one  was in a severe accident and
