 still  in a pretty  bad place i'm starting  to wake up and think of  suicide every morning  i  think about about jumping off  a  bridge are you using pills to  kill  myself  i can't  i can't do  this anymore  this is destroying me i  i  don't  even feel like i'm living  it's just  i feel like my family's given up on me  i feel alone  it feels like the only thing i can do  is  be on the computer for about <unk> minutes  i'm  gon na stop searching for explanations  i  don't know anyone  who's been through this  i  don't know anyone who's come back from  from four months of  this i mean  what's left of me  even if i get it together  i can't stop thinking of suicide  i can't stop  worrying  i can't stop comparing myself to other people  i'm saying everything that i don't have  i desperately need someone in my life  i can't  i can't make that happen because i  i can't even get out of bed i  remember  in october when this first happened  when i  when i just lost my mind  i was so confused and  so scared that  i asked my family for help  they said i need help  i don't know what's going on  i don't know how to  to make this stop or how to get better  they told me what what do you want us to do  what do you expect us to do  and they were angry that i had  i had asked something like that  no  i i didn't know what to do  and so  i i was some kind of failure  i tried to explain to them i just need help  i don't know what's going on  i don't know how to get better  and  it just looked at me and shrug their shoulders  said well we  can't help you  and you know how many visits i've gotten  from my sister  how  many  phone calls  to ask if i'm okay  done  any kind of support  an understanding  that  i  can't do this alone  none  i can't get better because i have no support system  i have no one that believes
