being here  i woke up so drunk  at  <unk> o'clock  in  the  afternoon  the next day and i  just felt so  pathetic  i was like what  am i  doing  with  my  life  and  i  just  felt  miserable  i was like why  am i  like this why  do i do this to  myself like i  am such a  <unk>  i can't do anything right  like i said i  it makes me feel worse that i  am  i have so much  potential  i  do  good at school and i  do  good at sports  i had an amazing job  and made some record to sales  record and  i had just  thrown that all away  and  i was just  unlocked bottom so  i had this moment that i  just didn't want to live anymore i  just didn't want to keep going and i've been having  like suicidal thoughts two  months before  nobody was home  and  i i  just went into some soul  like i  don't know  how to describe it i was just  i couldn't think of  anything positive  i was  so  low  i  just wanted to kill  myself i  just  wanted  to end  this and  i  tried  there was no wine at  home  except this one  bottle  it's like i don't know  <unk> percent or something i don't even know what it's called  and  i  took sleep  title them  down  with  that bottle  and  i said  on the kitchen floor  because i  got a  knife from there  and  started cutting myself  and  i  thought that was gon na  be  easy  because i  didn't really feel physical pain  at that stain  but it  just  um  was harder than i thought  so  i was like why  isn't this working like with a huge at night  and  it's always started like sawing  and i was just sawing  until i  fell asleep from the  pills  i thought that was my  rock bottom  but when  i woke  up  to my mom  <unk> out  crying  she found me on  the floor  and she was just  like  hysterical  and  i  music  had not thought about if it failed  but that happened  and that was  heartbreaking  to see  my mom there  music  and they made me throw  up then  i  was just watched  <unk>  my  best friend  came  over  and took me  to  the  hospital  and i was just my eyes were so  swollen  from crying  and  i  was just  a mess  and i  got a  few interviews  and  then  the  mental doctor came  he took me to  a mental  center  i stayed there for three days  talking  to  <unk> and  doctors and  nurses  and  i was  watched  <unk>  that really got to the  root of  the problem and that helped me a lot  i  got some answers  i took like a lot of tests  for  mental  health and  it was just a lot of depression and anxiety  and of  course alcoholism  so the first thing  i had to  do  was  go  to rehab to  them see how  bad  my  anxiety  and depression  is because alcohol  numbs you  i had to get alcohol  out of the  whole picture  to  them see i  was  theme and how  serious my  depression  and anxiety  and  so that's what's happening  now  my mom and dad were going  to  america  to visit my sister  and  they  decided to take me with them  because  they didn't want to  leave me  alone  now i'm  back  we were in america  for  a  week tomorrow is a  day  i have to  call  and let them know  that i'm  back  and go to rehab  and  i am  kind of nervous  i don't know  how it all  works  and i  never  thought i  would  be  in this position  because  i  don't know  there's nothing wrong with my  life  i have a very supportive  and  a good family  and  good friends  and  we're not poor  there's nothing wrong with you so  that's what people think  all the  time that something has to happen  for  people like me  i  guess  like something has to  be  wrong or something has to happen  or you  go through some  trauma or something  to end up like me  but it's just  mental disease really  there's nothing you  can  do about it like i'm certain
