 i'm here to  spread awareness because i feel like  suicide is something that people  think that they need to hide  and i feel like the more that people feel like they need to hide the fact that they are feeling suicidal bit more that suicide actually happens and more that  people attempt and the more that people  feel like  they're alone  so i feel like  when i come here to talk  about this very serious topic that more people can feel open to speak about their own experience to me or to other people around  them  or even come to <unk> and make their own video  like i've been inspired by sabrina trans i go to school with her  and she made a video similar to this and it really inspired me to make me push through and  make this video once again i don't  even know where  to  start if you new to my channel  i'm molly albrecht  um  i do makeup i'm a freelance makeup artist  and i have a lot of dreams  and hopes  for my own future  i hope to one day move to  la and to  pursue doing makeup in hollywood  or  come back here and pursue your makeup  here  in colorado  either way i want to go to school in la and i want to  pursue makeup in any  way that i  can  so  how did this all start  so in  elementary school i was  bullied for  having glasses  kids  would call me  ugly  they would call me fat  so here's one pair of the glasses that i used to wear a lot of the time  this i believe was the  pair that i wore  a lot in fourth  third grade  and then this  pink pair here was the pair that i wore a lot in  fourth grade so i was bullied a lot  and  elementary school and i feel like it is the main  reason why  i feel  so  down on myself still and never confident and never feel like i'm enough  i feel as though it's  hard it's a reason why i also  have a lot of hard times making  friends too  as a  child  i  have repressed memories  i don't know if you guys know what that means but it means basically just like  i have memories  of a time and an instance  that happened that  you're not quite sure if it happened because it's  forgotten  so basically you shut it out of your mind completely and then it comes back through dreams and you think it could be a memory  or it could not be a memory  or it's just a  continuous dream that keeps happening  so that happens with me  and  something that people call  molestation  not a fun topic and not something that people are very open about  either  and so  i remember distinctly  when i was a child  i remember it had started or i remember  from what i can remember  me asking  this family member  if you can get pregnant  from yourself  and said no  and then i  just  everything after that  was blank and i don't remember anything  the other thing that i do remember is that i would get scared at night  my feeling member would say hey  coming to my bed and you can just  hang out with me  and  i would be like  yeah  okay  i get rid of  whatever  problem i have in my own bed  and  i go  and i'd sleep with them and  i can't  i don't  have a memory  of ever  getting  inside  the bed  after i got inside i have no  memory at all as to what  happened  afterwards and those memories came back  around <unk>  grade  <unk>  grade  was the time that my dad  started  getting  to  gather with  my  <unk> and they started getting really super serious  and  i remember  that  that december he had proposed  to my <unk>  and it was also <unk> grade was also the first year that i haven't ever gotten <unk> and  with children in <unk> they're gon na follow whoever account they want to follow  so for me  i followed depressed pages and so reading through all those messages  made me  develop  a habit  of picking up a razor  my first time picking up  a razor  was in sixth grade i was upset about  something  i don't remember  exactly what it was but that  was the first time that i had ever picked up  a razor and i  slit my wrists  it was one of those feelings where  i felt relief and like i wanted to continue and to this day i still cannot break the habit of  whenever i feel sad or whenever i feel guilty or whenever i feel like i deserve it
