 oh boy  it's  sunday  yes it's sunday  and  i'm very tired  right now  it's  <unk> o'clock <unk> actually  in  the <unk>  and you know  i had a  relatively good day  but  at  the same time  i'm  in  another one of  my  <unk>  i feel hopeless again  i don't know why  i just really feel like  i'm not doing  it  and  it may just be the tiredness talking  but  i feel like there's no light at the end of the  tunnel and  i feel like  the more i try  the less success i feel like i'm getting  ever since  my mom's come home with my  dad  she's been in control of what i eat  and i thought that would be a  good  thing  but  sadly  now  i don't know what i'm eating  and i'm not comfortable not knowing  i'm not comfortable  i like my calorie counting system that i had  because i knew what i was getting and i knew what i was doing  and now i'm not in control of it  and i'm getting ticked off  so  my mom makes the foods that she knows i like  but the problem with the foods she knows i like  is that  they're  not exactly the foods i need to eat and they're not exactly the healthiest you have this casserole  it's a  little beautiful my favorite castle it's my favorite food it's a comfort food  and thing about comfort foods is they're  very high in calories  what it is is it's two cans of  cheddar soup  two cans of cream of chicken soup  like crave cheddar cream of chicken  six chicken breasts  cut  up  two cans of rice  and this is a double batch of course  two cans of rice  do you put potato chips on top  as like a crust  and you cover that in cheese  i love it  i do  it tastes it's amazing  but  i overeat it  and  i can't even control myself  when it comes to  that  i have no control over anything right now  i can't control what i'm eating i can't control myself from how much i eat  i can't control my weight  i  was doing so well  and now i feel  hopeless  and  um  i've been looking through  my <unk>  and  i think  my highest views is  eight  eight views is my highest  and that's okay  i'm okay with  that  but  i feel like  i'm not really talking to anybody  and i'm feeling like no one's there for  me  and it's hard for me to stay motivated  trying to keep myself more of it by doing this  but  i don't know if i can do it if no one else supports  me  um  i'm just scared  i want to go to university and i want to  have this  great student life where i  am suave and i get work done and  you know
